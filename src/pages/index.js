                  description="During my work as a security engineer on the CatenaX project, I made a significant discovery. We had integrated the Veracode tool, and developers could only access their findings by switching to the Veracode platform. This meant that developers had to go through the time-comsuming process of logging into another platform, creating a new set of credentials, requesting access, and then attempting to locate their findings within the huge Veracode platform. It was an ineffective and frustrating process."
