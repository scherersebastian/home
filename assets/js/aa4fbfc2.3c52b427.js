The purpose of this article is to serve as a summary since I found the content of the GitHub articles to be well-structured. My personal thoughts are integrated at relevant points._\\r\\n\\r\\nContinuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) software supply chains are a lucrative target for threat actors. GitHub Actions is one of the most widely used platforms for automation, making it an important target. It\'s my personal favourite compared to GitLab CI/CD and Jenkins.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the context of workflows, the _primary_ threats include: Command Injections, Pwn Requests, Secret Leaks, and Third-Party Actions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the dangers inherent to _automatic processing of PRs_, an important security guarantee that GitHub makes is that workflows triggered on `pull_request` from forks (untrusted sources) are run with minimal privileges: no access to secrets and the repository token is read-only. Thus, if a workflow contains potential injection vulnerabilities, but is triggered only on `pull_request`, then the impact is minimal, because only pull requests from users able to create branches in the same repository are able to trigger the workflow with higher privileges.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Nevertheless, it is better to keep workflows injection free, even if they run with minimal privileges._\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the following sections, the primary threats will be listed along with corresponding tips for mitigation.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Command Injections\\r\\n\\r\\nA workflow is a program that starts automatically when a specific repository event occurs. As with any program potentially started by an external user, user-controlled inputs should be treated as untrusted. In the context of workflows, this means values such as `github.event.issue.title` or `github.event.issue.body`. In particular, GitHub Actions expression evaluation is a powerful language-independent feature which may lead to script injections when used in such blocks as `run`.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a simple example of a workflow that is vulnerable to command injection:\\r\\n\\r\\n```yaml\\r\\n- run: echo \\"${{ github.event.issue.title }}\\"\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nTo exploit this, an attacker would create an issue with a title like `$(touch pwned.txt)`.\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the way that the `${{}}` syntax gets expanded, this causes the workflow to execute the following command `echo \\"$(touch pwned.txt)\\"`.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince expression evaluation is language independent, the injection type is not Bash shell-specific. For example, when `${{}}` is used in a JS script, a syntactically valid construct can be used for injection there, too.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn attacker could use an injection vulnerability like this to achieve something far more malicious than just modifying a local file. For example, they could upload secrets to a website that they control, or commit new code to your repository to add a backdoor vulnerability or supply chain attack.\\r\\n\\r\\n_When used in the `run` or `script` section, the `${{ }}` syntax is almost always very dangerous._\\r\\n\\r\\n### Tip 1: Don\u2019t Use ${{ }} Syntax in the Run Section to Prevent Unexpected Substitution Issues\\r\\n\\r\\nThe recommendation is to use _intermediate environment variables_ for the potentially untrusted input and then use language-specific capabilities to retrieve the value of the variable:\\r\\n\\r\\n```yaml\\r\\n- name: print title\\r\\n  env:\\r\\n    TITLE: ${{ github.event.issue.title }}\\r\\n  run: echo \\"$TITLE\\"\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nor\\r\\n\\r\\n```yaml\\r\\n- name: print title\\r\\n  env:\\r\\n    TITLE: ${{ github.event.issue.title }}\\r\\n  uses: actions/github-script@v6\\r\\n  with:\\r\\n    script: console.log(process.env.TITLE)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing the `${{ }}` syntax in the `env` section is safer because the user-controlled string is stored in a variable instead. The syntax `\\"$TITLE\\"` in the updated `run` section is standard Bash syntax, which is widely known and therefore less likely to behave in a way that the author of the workflow didn\u2019t expect. Similarly, the syntax `process.env.TITLE` is standard JavaScript syntax, so the code will behave as expected for a JavaScript program.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Please note that this solution doesn\u2019t prevent other types of vulnerabilities: the `TITLE` environment still contains untrusted input and still needs to be handled with care._\\r\\n\\r\\nWe should carefully handle potentially untrusted input and make sure it doesn\u2019t flow into API calls where the data could be interpreted as code.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Tip 2: Enable Code Scanning for Workflows\\r\\n\\r\\n**I recommend carefully reviewing your workflows, focusing on the usage of untrusted input.**\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, to prevent accidentally introducing similar vulnerabilities in new code, I recommend to utilize code scanning for the repository.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis allows for the automation of workflow reviews. Custom queries can be written to make the scans more precise.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen using CodeQL for scanning, the following considerations must be kept in mind. _The CodeQL workflow scanning queries are (currently) only included in the query suite for JavaScript, so they\u2019re only enabled by default if your project is written in JavaScript._ If the main programming language of your project is something else, such as Python or Java, then you need to manually modify the CodeQL workflow to add JavaScript as an additional language. The scanning will work even if your repository doesn\u2019t contain any JavaScript; and if you are interested only in workflows, but not other JavaScript files, you can exclude some paths in the CodeQL configuration:\\r\\n\\r\\n```yaml\\r\\npaths:\\r\\n  - .github\\r\\npaths-ignore:\\r\\n  - .github/workflows/test.yaml\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nOther scanning tools can also be used. For example, KICS provides pre-configured queries that can be extended. A simple script that, for instance, looks for `${{}}`, `pull_request_target`, and `workflow_run` can be quite effective. This way, a dedicated security team can review many repositories, and development teams don\'t need to delve into the details, allowing them to focus on their development work.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Pwn Requests\\r\\n\\r\\nAny automated processing of PRs from an external fork is potentially dangerous and such PRs should be treated like untrusted input. It is common CI/CD practice to ensure that when a new PR is submitted that it does not break the build for your project, that no functionality regressions are introduced, and that tests are passing. But when operating on untrusted PRs, such automated behavior can leave your repository exposed to abuse if you\u2019re not careful.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince, by definition, a PR supplies code to any build or test logic in place for your project, attackers can achieve arbitrary code execution in a workflow runner operating on a malicious PR in a variety of ways.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey may submit malicious changes to the existing build scripts like `make` or `powershell` files or redefine the build script in the `package.json` file. They can simply write their payload as a new test that will be run with others. Any modern build orchestration is complex enough to have multiple code injection points.\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the dangers inherent to automatic processing of PRs, GitHub\u2019s standard pull_request workflow trigger by default prevents write permissions and secrets access to the target repository.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, in some scenarios such access is needed to properly process the PR. To this end the `pull_request_target` and `workflow_run` workflow triggers were introduced. They enable scenarios that require building the untrusted code, access to repository secrets and also need write permissions to update the PR with e.g. code coverage results or other test results.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Tip 3: Do Not Use `pull_request_target`\\r\\n\\r\\nMy personal advice is to never use these workflow triggers because they unnecessarily increase the attack surface. They automatically commit you to closely monitoring every PR.\\r\\n\\r\\nStatement from [GitHub Security Lab](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/):\\r\\n\\r\\n_\\"Generally speaking, when the PR contents are treated as passive data, i.e. not in a position of influence over the build/testing process, it is safe. But the repository owners must be extra careful not to trigger any script that may operate on PR controlled contents like in the case of `npm install`.\\"_\\r\\n\\r\\nAvoid using `pull_request_target` if the workflow doesn\u2019t need write repository permissions and doesn\u2019t use any repository secrets. They can simply use the `pull_request` trigger instead.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou may ask yourself: if the `pull_request_target` workflow only checks out and builds the PR, i.e. runs untrusted code but doesn\u2019t reference any secrets, is it still vulnerable?\\r\\n\\r\\nYes it is, because a workflow triggered on `pull_request_target` still has the read/write repository token in memory that is potentially available to any running program. If the workflow uses `actions/checkout` and does not pass the optional parameter `persist-credentials` as `false`, it makes it even worse. The default for the parameter is `true`. It means that in any subsequent steps any running code can simply read the stored repository token from the disk.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust stick to the `pull_request` trigger.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Tip 4: Add a Condition to the `pull_request_target`\\r\\n\\r\\nAdd a condition to the `pull_request_target` to run only if a certain label is assigned the PR, like `safe to test` that indicates the PR has been vetted by someone with write privileges to the target repository. Note that this kind of label based verification is still prone to a race condition in which the attacker may push new changes after the workflow was approved (labeled), but has not started yet. As such this approach should only be used as a temporary solution, until a proper fix from the options above is applied. Since external users do not have the permission to assign labels, this effectively requires repository owners to manually review changes first and is also prone to human error.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Tip 5: Rebase PRs After Fixing a Vulnerable Workflow\\r\\n\\r\\nAll PRs that were opened before a fix was made to the vulnerable workflow will use the version of the workflow as it existed at the time the PR was opened. That means that if there is a pending PR, any updates to the PR may still abuse the vulnerable workflow. It is advisable to either close or rebase such PRs if untrusted commits may be added to them after a vulnerable workflow is fixed.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Secret Leaks\\r\\n\\r\\nWorkflows triggered via the `pull_request` event from forks have read-only permissions and no access to secrets. With it, the triggered workflow runs in the context of the (submitter\'s) fork repo. Therefore the provided `GITHUB_TOKEN` will not have write access and the secrets are not accessible either.\\r\\nHowever, these permissions differ between the various event triggers such as `issue_comment`, `issues` and `push`. An attacker could try to steal the repository secrets or even the repository write access token. If a secret or token is set to an environment variable like:\\r\\n\\r\\n```yaml\\r\\nenv:\\r\\n  GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}\\r\\n  PUBLISH_KEY: ${{ secrets.PUBLISH_KEY }}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nIt can be directly accessed through the environment as demonstrated with e.g.: `printenv`.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the secret is used directly in a expression like:\\r\\n\\r\\n```yaml\\r\\n- run: publisher ${{ secrets.PUBLISH_KEY }}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nor\\r\\n\\r\\n```yaml\\r\\nuses: fakeaction/publish@v3\\r\\nwith:\\r\\n  key: ${{ secrets.PUBLISH_KEY }}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, in the first case, the generated shell script is stored on disk and can be accessed there. In the second case it depends on the way the program is using the argument.\\r\\n\\r\\n`Actions/checkout` action by default stores the repository token in a `.git/config` file unless the `persist-credentials: false` argument is set. Even if this is not the case the repository token and secrets are still in memory. Although GitHub Actions scrub secrets from memory that are not referenced in the workflow or in an included Action, the repository token, whether it is referenced or not, and any referenced secrets can be harvested by a determined attacker.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next question for the attacker is how to exfiltrate such secrets from the runner. GitHub Actions automatically redact secrets printed to the log in order to prevent accidental secret disclosure, but it is not a true security boundary since it is impossible to protect from intentional logging, so exfiltration of obfuscated secrets is still possible. For example: `echo ${SOME_SECRET:0:4}; echo ${SOME_SECRET:4:200};`. Also, since the attacker may run arbitrary commands it is possible to simply make a HTTP request to an external attacker-controlled server with the secret.\\r\\n\\r\\nGetting a repository access token is a bit harder. An Action runner gets a generated token with permissions that are limited to the repository that contains the workflow and which expires after the workflow completes. Once expired, the token is no longer useful to an attacker. One way to work around this limitation, is to automate the attack and perform it in fractions of a second by calling an attacker-controlled server with the token. The attacker server can use the GitHub API to modify repository content, including releases.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Tip 6: Keep Workflows Injection free\\r\\n\\r\\nKeep workflows injection free, even if they run with minimal privileges.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best practice to avoid code and command injection vulnerabilities in GitHub workflows is to set the untrusted input value of the expression to an intermediate environment variable, as previously described.\\r\\n\\r\\nRefer to the section above on Command Injections for more information.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Tip 7: Use the Principle of Least Privilege\\r\\n\\r\\nGitHub introduced a more fine grained permission model for workflow tokens (`GITHUB_TOKEN`) and, today, the default permissions for new repositories and organizations are set to read-only.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you want to check if you are using a broad default permission for your workflow tokens, you can go to the _repository (or organization) settings->actions and check the \u201cWorkflow permissions\u201d section_.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery GitHub workflow receives a temporary repository access token (`GITHUB_TOKEN`).\\r\\n\\r\\nTo help you more smoothly navigate the transition to a least-privilege workflow token model, we have published a set of GitHub Actions that allow you to monitor and enumerate the set of privileges that are required by a given GitHub workflow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe [Monitor action](https://github.com/GitHubSecurityLab/actions-permissions/tree/main/monitor) installs a local proxy (no information is sent to any third parties) into your workflow runner, collects information about any GitHub API interactions initiated by the workflow, and then displays the recommended minimal permissions as part of a workflow run summary:\\r\\n\\r\\n![Monitor action](assets/actions-tool-1.webp)\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can grant additional permissions to specific workflows on a case-by-case basis if needed:\\r\\n\\r\\n```yaml\\r\\njobs:\\r\\n  job_name:\\r\\n  ...\\r\\n    permissions:\\r\\n      issues: write\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nIf access to any scope is specified, all unspecified scopes like `contents`, `pull-requests` or `actions` are set to `none`.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Third-Party Actions\\r\\n\\r\\nActions allow you to quickly create automatic workflows from convenient building blocks: actions published by other developers. _GitHub Marketplace_ has thousands of free actions available for consumption.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy referencing an action with the uses: directive, you\u2019re running third-party code and giving it access to:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Computing time\\r\\n\\r\\n- Secrets used in the same workflow job\\r\\n\\r\\n- Your repository token\\r\\n\\r\\nRead access to secrets, such as deployment keys, could also be used by malicious actors for lateral movement (in other words, for compromising other resources). Although only the secrets referenced or used in the workflow job are potentially accessible to the action, the repository token is different. Even if the GITHUB_TOKEN is not explicitly used in a workflow, it\u2019s still available for all referenced actions. Attackers that control the YAML definition of the action may add, for example, a new input field and set the default value to the repository token:\\r\\n\\r\\n```yaml\\r\\ninputs:\\r\\n  random_name:\\r\\n    default: ${{ github.token }}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\u2019s fair to assume that anyone who controls the YAML action definition has access to the temporary repository token in a context of the running workflow that consumes the action. This means you should carefully review the permissions you supply to the workflows you\u2019re running.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Tip 8: Following the Principle of Least Privilege\\r\\n\\r\\nThe principle of least privilege states that software should run with the minimal set of permissions needed to accomplish the task. This applies both to the privileges of secrets available for your workflows and the automatically supplied temporary repository token (`GITHUB_TOKEN`), which is based on the workflow trigger type.\\r\\n\\r\\nRefer to the previous subsection above on least privilege for more information.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Tip 9: Properly Referencing Actions\\r\\n\\r\\nAdding a new action to a workflow requires careful consideration of security impact.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome actions have a _\u201cVerified creator\u201d_ badge that can help you decide the level of trust you place in the action creator. It is not yet common and therefore unfortunately not very helpful.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best approach is to audit the code behind the action, just like you would for open source libraries, to assess whether it\u2019s reasonably secure and doesn\u2019t do anything suspicious like sending secrets to third-party hosts. Thankfully, many actions are designed for a single purpose and are relatively easy to read.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce you\u2019ve verified the action\u2019s code, there are multiple ways of referencing it in your workflow:\\r\\n\\r\\n- **By full hash changeset reference**: `uses: owner/action-name@26968a09c0ea4f3e233fdddbafd1166051a095f6`. Currently, this is the safest way to reference a specific snapshot of an action.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Fork the action**: Depending on your needs, you could fork the action and reference the fork in your workflows. You may need to set up vetted updates from the original repository in order to get potential security fixes, though. _Makes particular sense for actions that are commonly used across the enterprise._\\r\\n\\r\\nAs you can see, all options are a tradeoff between guaranteed supply chain integrity and auto-patching of vulnerabilities in dependencies / actions. In all cases except the last, it\u2019s possible to configure Dependabot to create a pull request when the action is updated. In order to protect repository secrets, such pull requests are treated as if they come from external forks. You can set up actions to automatically accept and merge these pull requests from Dependabot. However, accepting changes without reviewing them isn\u2019t the most secure approach. Every time the referenced action is updated, I recommend that you verify what has changed in the action source code - _that\'s a real challenge to keep up with_.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Conclusion\\r\\n\\r\\nGitHub Actions are a great way to rapidly build a functional CI/CD pipeline for your GitHub projects. From an attacker\u2019s perspective, they are part of a much broader CI/CD attack surface that also includes any third-party artifact integrations and API interactions. Beyond the usual code review for untrusted input handling, CI/CD supply chain integrity requires careful vetting of your dependencies and any changes that occur in those dependencies. By applying the concepts of least privilege, change attestation, and tracking as well as ensuring that third parties don\u2019t have mutable control over your CI/CD supply chain, you can actively start to take charge of your CI/CD supply chain security.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Resources\\r\\n\\r\\n- [Four tips to keep your GitHub Actions workflows secure](https://github.blog/2023-08-09-four-tips-to-keep-your-github-actions-workflows-secure/)\\r\\n\\r\\n- [Keeping your GitHub Actions and workflows secure Part 1: Preventing pwn requests](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/)\\r\\n\\r\\n- [Keeping your GitHub Actions and workflows secure Part 2: Untrusted input](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-untrusted-input/)\\r\\n\\r\\n- [Keeping your GitHub Actions and workflows secure Part 3: How to trust your building blocks](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-building-blocks/)\\r\\n\\r\\n- [GitHub Actions Security Best Practices - cheat sheet included](https://blog.gitguardian.com/github-actions-security-cheat-sheet/)"},{"id":"do-users-write-more-insecure-code-with-ai-assistants","metadata":{"permalink":"/home/blog/do-users-write-more-insecure-code-with-ai-assistants","editUrl":"https://github.com/scherersebastian/home/blob/main/blog/2024-01-21-do-users-write-more-insecure-code-with-ai-assistants/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-01-21-do-users-write-more-insecure-code-with-ai-assistants/index.md","title":"Do Users Write More Insecure Code with AI Assistants?","description":"The paper \\"Do Users Write More Insecure Code with AI Assistants?\\" focuses on a study examining user interactions with an AI Code assistant in programming tasks, particularly those involving security.

This will trigger the workflow, and the IssueInjector action will process the SARIF file and create issues based on the findings.\\n\\n4. _Check for Issues:_ After the workflow runs, check your GitHub repository\'s \\"Issues\\" tab for newly created issues.\\n\\n### Inputs\\n\\n| Input          | Description                                          | Required | Default |\\n| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------- |\\n| `SARIF_FILE`   | Path to the SARIF file                               | Yes      |         |\\n| `SEVERITY`     | Severity level to filter                             | No       | `error` |\\n| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub token to authenticate with the API            | Yes      |         |\\n| `GITHUB_REPO`  | The GitHub repository where issues should be created | Yes      |         |\\n\\n## Limitations\\n\\n- Once closed, issues remain closed: If an issue is manually closed, the script won\'t reopen it even if the finding reappears in a new scan.\\n\\n- No branch support: The current version of the script doesn\'t distinguish between different branches. It assumes that all findings are relevant to the default or main branch.\\n\\n- Location changes result in hash mismatch: If the location of a finding is changed, such as by renaming a file, the hash generated for that finding will differ. This could lead to duplicate issues being created.\\n\\n- IssueInjector is _soft release ready_, indicating potential bugs. One known limitation is inconsistent issue creation due to missing or varied SARIF file values across different tools. Feedback on discrepancies is appreciated to enhance the tool\'s performance."},{"id":"full-disclosure-ensuring-everyone-has-the-information-they-need","metadata":{"permalink":"/home/blog/full-disclosure-ensuring-everyone-has-the-information-they-need","editUrl":"https://github.com/scherersebastian/home/blob/main/blog/2023-10-13-full-disclosure-ensuring-everyone-has-the-information-they-need/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-10-13-full-disclosure-ensuring-everyone-has-the-information-they-need/index.md","title":"Full Disclosure: Ensuring Everyone Has the Information They Need","description":"While I personally lean towards the Coordinated Disclosure approach, in this article I delve deep into the perspective of my more free-thinking security colleagues to better understand their viewpoint.","date":"2023-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 13, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Security","permalink":"/home/blog/tags/security"},{"label":"Full Disclosure","permalink":"/home/blog/tags/full-disclosure"}],"readingTime":2.52,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Scherer","title":"Security Engineer","url":"https://scherersebastian.github.io/home/","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59142915?v=4","key":"scherersebastian"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"full-disclosure-ensuring-everyone-has-the-information-they-need","authors":"scherersebastian","tags":["Security","Full Disclosure"]},"prevItem":{"title":"IssueInjector: Centralizing All Security Findings in GitHub Without Paying for Advanced Security","permalink":"/home/blog/issueinjector-centralizing-all-security-findings-in-github-without-paying-for-advanced-security"},"nextItem":{"title":"How to Suck at Information Security","permalink":"/home/blog/how-to-suck-at-information-security"}},"content":"_While I personally lean towards the Coordinated Disclosure approach, in this article I delve deep into the perspective of my more free-thinking security colleagues to better understand their viewpoint._\\n\\nEnsuring that software or hardware vendors can address vulnerabilities before bad actors can find and exploit them is crucial.\\n\\nVulnerability disclosures can be controversial because vendors often prefer to wait until a patch or other form of mitigation is available before making the vulnerability public. However, security professionals and enterprises whose sensitive data or systems may be at risk prefer that disclosures be made public as soon as possible.\\n\\nAll software has security vulnerabilities, and demonstrating a clear and established process for handling and disclosing them gives far more confidence in the security of the software than trying to hide the issues.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n![Twitter disclosure](assets/twitter-disclosure.png)\\n\\n_As a side note, [this happened](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/security-researcher-launches-gofundme-campaign-to-fight-legal-threat-over-vulnerability-disclosure) before Elon Musk acquired Twitter._\\n\\n**Full disclosure** is the practice of publishing analysis of software vulnerabilities as early as possible, making the data accessible to everyone without restriction. The primary purpose of widely disseminating information about vulnerabilities is so that potential victims are as knowledgeable as those who attack them.\\n\\n> _\\"Full disclosure, - the practice of making the details of security vulnerabilities public - is a damned good idea.

This meant that developers had to go through the time-comsuming process of logging into another platform, creating a new set of credentials, requesting access, and then attempting to locate their findings within the huge Veracode platform. It was an ineffective and frustrating process.\\n\\nOut of this pain and the desire to streamline the workflow for developers, I created [**IssueInjector**](https://github.com/scherersebastian/issue-injector). For a deeper dive into the technical details of Issue Injector, you can refer to a separate article. In this article, we\'ll focus on why this workflow is so beneficial for developers.\\n\\nIn the realm of security, ensuring that vulnerabilities are addressed promptly is of utmost importance. But when and how should these vulnerabilities be shared within an organization?\\n\\nThis article explores the idea of seamlessly integrating findings and potential threats directly into the development workflow as issues or stories.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nSuch an approach not only streamlines the process but also empowers developers to address security concerns efficiently without leaving their familiar development environment.\\n\\n## The Efficiency of Integrated Findings\\n\\nTraditionally, security findings and potential threats have been reported via email or external reports, often leading to communication challenges and a lack of integration into the development workflow. However, there are compelling reasons to advocate for reporting these concerns as issues or stories directly within the development project, whether it\'s innersource or a private repository.\\n\\n**Why is this approach beneficial?**\\n\\nImagine a scenario where a company employs multiple security tools for SCA (Software Composition Analysis), SAST (Static Application Security Testing), DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing), Secret Scanning, and Container Scanning. In a traditional setup, developers would need to switch between multiple dashboards and tools to access findings from each security tool. This can be time-consuming and disrupt the development workflow.\\n\\n:::info\\n\\nThis is what happens when you let security people with no engineering background develop a developer-friendly security process.\\n\\n:::\\n\\nHere\'s where the GitHub action [**IssueInjector**](https://github.com/scherersebastian/issue-injector) becomes invaluable. If you want to give it a try, it can make a world of difference.\\n\\nBy reporting findings directly as issues or stories within the development environment, security teams can seamlessly integrate security concerns into the ongoing development process. Developers no longer need to switch between different dashboards or tools to access critical information. Instead, they can address vulnerabilities right where they work, ensuring a more efficient and collaborative approach to security.\\n\\n![GitHub security issue](assets/open-issue.png)\\n\\n## The Case for Internal Issue Reporting\\n\\n### Advantages of Reporting Issues within Development Projects\\n\\n- **Seamless Integration**: Findings are directly integrated into the development workflow, ensuring they are rapidly addressed and resolved.\\n\\n- **Enhanced Transparency**: Tracking vulnerabilities as issues within the development project promotes a culture of openness and proactivity. This fosters trust and collaboration among team members, ensuring everyone is on the same page regarding security concerns.\\n\\n- **Efficiency**: Teams no longer need to wait for formal reports or analyses to address vulnerabilities. They can take immediate action to rectify the issue, significantly reducing the time it takes to mitigate security risks.\\n\\n- **Accountability**: Open communication about vulnerabilities ensures that the entire development team is aware of the risks and takes collective responsibility for their resolution.\\n\\nIn this context, the integration of findings into the development project, whether it\'s innersource or private, offers a more efficient and organized approach to managing security concerns. Issues are neatly contained within the project, eliminating the need for separate email reports and enhancing collaboration between security and development teams.\\n\\n### Possible Disadvantages of Internal Issue Reporting\\n\\nWhile integrating findings as development issues offers numerous advantages, it\'s essential to consider _potential_ disadvantages:\\n\\n- **Overwhelming Developers**: If not managed properly, a flood of security issues can overwhelm developers and hinder their ability to address critical vulnerabilities effectively.\\n\\n- **False Positives**: Security tools produce false positive findings, leading to unnecessary interruptions in the development workflow and decreased trust in the reporting process.\\n\\n- **Sensitivity of Data**: In cases where security findings involve sensitive or confidential data, reporting them as issues within the development project may pose data privacy and compliance challenges.\\n\\nIt\'s crucial to proactively manage these potential drawbacks by focusing primarily on high-severity issues, as they tend to be more manageable in quantity.\\n\\nIn cases of false positives, developers can promptly handle them by either closing the issues or disregarding them. After all, we\'re well aware of how meticulously backlogs tend to be maintained, right?\\n\\nRegarding the sensitivity of data, _most developers are so focused on their workloads that they rarely have the time or inclination to browse through the issues of other teams. The exception might be business informatics experts who cannot code themselves and may resort to copying from others - I\'m not speaking from personal experience._\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nWhile the public sphere often necessitates a coordinated approach to vulnerability disclosure, the insulated environment of a corporation provides an ideal context for efficient internal issue reporting. This approach not only promotes transparency, accountability, and efficiency but also enhances collaboration between development and security teams. By streamlining the integration of findings as development issues or stories, organizations can strengthen their security posture and respond more effectively to potential threats."},{"id":"car-privacy-mozillas-observations","metadata":{"permalink":"/home/blog/car-privacy-mozillas-observations","editUrl":"https://github.com/scherersebastian/home/blob/main/blog/2023-10-02-car-privacy-mozillas-observations/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-10-02-car-privacy-mozillas-observations/index.md","title":"Car Privacy: Mozilla\'s Observations","description":"Let me preface this by saying I\'m usually not a big fan of compliance and privacy discussions.

The crux? The appendages at the tail-end. It isn\'t a mere glitch; researchers have systematically showcased how to automate the construction of these adversarial prompt injections.\\n\\n### Depth and Breadth of Vulnerabilities\\n\\nWhile specific instances like the one above can be patched, the broader issue is the unlimited possibilities these attacks represent. Researchers have created an algorithmic approach to devise these adversarial attacks on LLMs, potentially making a vast number of such vulnerabilities.\\n\\n### Cross-Model Vulnerabilities\\n\\nOne might argue: \\"Okay, but that\u2019s for open-source models.\\" Here\u2019s the rub: these attacks, once crafted using open-source LLMs, have proven effective even against closed-source models like ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude. The implications are vast: craft on one model, attack on many.\\n\\n### Open Questions\\n\\nAs with any groundbreaking discovery, this raises more questions. For instance, does fine-tuning these attacks on a more potent open-source model guarantee broader and more potent jailbreaks? It appears likely. However, one of the looming concerns is the potential backlash against open-source. While vulnerabilities in open systems can be identified, they are instrumental in hardening both open and closed systems.\\n\\n### Reality Check\\n\\nGiven the inherent nature of LLMs and the infinite ways they can be attacked, achieving a completely secure LLM may remain a pipe dream.\\n\\nFor the specifics, the researchers used Viccuna-7B and LLaMA-2-7B-Chat for initial attack development. When tested on other models such as Pythia, Falcon, Guanaco, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, PaLM-2, and Claude-2, the success rates varied but remained notably high.\\n\\n### Methodology Spotlight\\n\\nKey to this attack mechanism is the Greedy Coordinate Gradient-based Search. By optimizing input tokens, this technique is designed to maximize the probability of eliciting a desired response from the LLM, even if it\u2019s potentially harmful.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIf you\'re in the LLM space, whether as a researcher, developer, or an enthusiast, this is a must-read. Dive into the paper for an in-depth understanding and figure out where we head from here.\\n\\nPublished on 27th July 2023, this paper has since drawn massive attention from the AI community, and the highlighted vulnerabilities have been _partially_ fixed.

The challenge now? Mastering the art of prompt engineering to communicate effectively with this unparalleled digital assistant.\\n\\nIf you think ChatGPT is just a toy to generate random text, you\'re wildly missing the mark. This model can be your trusty sidekick, an assistant that can tackle anything from code to research. But you\'ve got to know how to talk to it. No, I don\'t mean saying _please_ and _thank you_.\\n\\nPrompt engineering is not straightforward; it requires careful thought and various considerations.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n![Prompt engineering meme](assets/prompt-engineering-dark-art.jpeg)\\n\\n## The Principles of Prompting: The Basics\\n\\nAlright, before we get into the nitty-gritty techniques, let\'s set the stage with some principles.\\n\\n- Write **clear, detailed** instructions.\\n\\n- Specify the **format**, like summaries, lists, or bullet points.\\n\\n- Use **system messages and role-playing** to enhance the interaction.\\n\\n- Limit **scope** for broad topics.\\n\\n- Avoid leading the model to a specific answer.\\n\\n**Instead of:**\\n\\n> Write 5 tech articles.\\n\\n**A well-engineered prompt would look like:**\\n\\n> Generate titles and abstracts for 5 tech articles focusing on the impact of machine learning on healthcare. Each abstract should be around 100-150 words. Aim for topics that would be relevant for CTOs of healthcare startups. Output the results as a numbered list.\\n\\nHere, the revised prompt leaves no room for misinterpretation. It clearly specifies the number of articles, the subject focus (machine learning in healthcare), the target audience (CTOs of healthcare startups), and even the format in which the output should be presented. The more specific you are, the more accurate and tailored the output will be.\\n\\n## Prompt Wording\\n\\nThe way you phrase your prompt is crucial for getting the output you want from a language learning model like ChatGPT. The model needs clear and accurate language to deliver useful answers. If you\'re not sure about the terminology in a particular field, this could limit the quality of the model\'s responses\u2014think of it like doing a web search with the wrong keywords.\\n\\nEssentially, prompt wording isn\'t a standalone method but serves as the backbone for all other prompting techniques.\\n\\n_Sorry PHP developers, you still have to learn a new proper language._\\n\\n## Prompt Engineering Strategies\\n\\n### Input/Output Prompting\\n\\nThe elementary method of asking and receiving.\\n\\nInstead of:\\n\\n> Translate the following text into French.\\n\\nSay:\\n\\n> Translate the following English text into French: \\"The weather is fine.\\"\\n\\nClarity is king. Specificity leads to more accurate outputs.\\n\\n### Zero-Shot, One-Shot, and Few-Shot Prompting\\n\\nZero-Shot is like throwing a dart in the dark; One-Shot and Few-Shot light up the board.\\n\\n> Zero-Shot: Recommend some video games.\\n> One-Shot: Recommend video games similar to \\"Animal Crossing.\\"\\n> Few-Shot: Recommend video games based on my liking for \\"Animal Crossing,\\" \\"Stardew Valley,\\" and \\"Harvest Moon.\\"\\n\\nYour level of specificity dictates the relevance of the recommendations.\\n\\nZero-shot uses the model\'s existing training to answer queries without additional data. Few-shot prompting uses limited additional examples to guide the model to a desired output. For example, specifying personal preferences like \\"Ania\'s favorite foods are burgers, fries, and pizza\\" can help the model give restaurant recommendations in a location like Dubai.\\n\\n### Chain-of-Thought Prompting\\n\\nFor problems that require more brainpower, guide the model through a logical progression.\\n\\n> How would you optimize a bubble sort algorithm for efficiency? Think this through step by step.\\n\\nThis will make the model break down the problem logically, perhaps suggesting using a different sorting algorithm altogether.\\n\\n### Self-Criticism\\n\\nMachines aren\'t perfect. Teach the LLM to critique its work for increased accuracy.\\n\\n> Review the SQL query you just generated. Does it follow best practices? If not, please rewrite it.\\n\\nThis will get the model to scrutinize its own output, allowing you to catch and correct errors proactively.\\n\\n### Iterative Prompting\\n\\nBig problems? Break \'em down into digestible pieces and solve them one at a time.\\n\\nYou could first ask for a list of top cybersecurity threats for 2023, then inquire about mitigation strategies for each. Baby steps will get you there.\\n\\n### Prompting for Prompts\\n\\nHave ChatGPT help you ask better questions. For example:\\n\\n> What kind of prompt would help you generate a more efficient sorting algorithm?\\n\\n### Model-Guided Prompting\\n\\nChatGPT can ask you for the info it needs to perform a specific task.\\n\\n> Develop a machine learning model for sentiment analysis. What do you need to know from me?\\n\\nThis eliminates guesswork and leads to a more customized output.\\n\\n## AI Hallucinations\\n\\nIn the realm of prompt engineering with language models like GPT-4, one phenomenon that can\'t be ignored is that of AI hallucinations. Simply put, an AI hallucination occurs when the model outputs data that is either blatantly incorrect or unusually distorted, often due to the misinterpretation of the input prompt or the underlying training data.\\n\\nIn machine learning, a model\'s ability to generalize from its training data to unseen data is crucial. However, sometimes this generalization goes awry. The model might extrapolate from its training in ways that, while mathematically plausible given its training set, are practically nonsensical or misleading.\\n\\nGoogle\'s Deep Dream serves as a quintessential example in the image domain, transforming benign pictures into nightmarish arrays of repetitive patterns. While entertaining in the context of art, hallucinations can become problematic when we rely on the model for mission-critical tasks such as medical diagnosis, financial analysis, or autonomous vehicle control.\\n\\n### Mitigating the Risk\\n\\nThere are several ways to detect and mitigate the risks of AI hallucinations:\\n\\n1. Data Quality: Ensure that the model is trained on high-quality, unbiased data.\\n\\n2. Model Auditing: Regularly evaluate the model\'s output in different scenarios to identify any erratic behavior.\\n\\n3. Output Validation: Include a layer of human oversight or automated checks to validate the model\'s output against known parameters or ground truth.\\n\\n### Best Practice: Review Your Outputs\\n\\nIt\'s essential to critically review any machine-generated output, particularly in contexts where an incorrect response can have significant ramifications.\\n\\nBy understanding the mechanics and pitfalls of AI hallucinations, engineers can better anticipate these anomalies and put measures in place to prevent or catch them, thereby ensuring more robust and reliable machine learning implementations.\\n\\n## Text Embeddings\\n\\nText embeddings convert textual data into high-dimensional vectors that capture semantic meaning, serving as the backbone of any natural language processing (NLP) based application.\\n\\nUnderstanding textual data is essential for companies that deal with customer interactions, analytics, or decision-making based on textual information. Text embeddings can supercharge applications like customer service chatbots, sentiment analysis tools, or search engines to offer accurate and contextually relevant results.\\n\\nImagine a chatbot integrated into Mercedes\' online showroom platform, designed to help potential customers with their car-buying experience. A customer might ask, _\\"Tell me about the fuel efficiency of the E-Class.\\"_ Another might inquire, _\\"What\'s the gas mileage on the E-Class sedan?\\"_\\n\\nBy leveraging text embeddings, the chatbot can understand that \\"fuel efficiency\\" and \\"gas mileage\\" are semantically similar queries, even though the wording is different. These terms are converted into high-dimensional vectors that cluster closely in the semantic space, allowing the chatbot to recognize them as related.\\n\\nWith this capability, the chatbot can provide detailed and relevant information to potential buyers, enhancing the customer experience and possibly accelerating the sales process. This is particularly important for a premium brand like Mercedes, where customers expect high levels of personalized service. Text embeddings make the chatbot more adaptable and efficient, which is crucial for a luxury automaker aiming to offer a customer experience as polished as the cars it sells.\\n\\nIn summary, text embeddings are vital for companies seeking to leverage NLP in targeted applications, offering superior understanding and performance compared to traditional lexical methods.\\n\\n## A Hands-on Example\\n\\nBelow, we delve into a practical illustration. Here is an example of a crafted prompt used in a Supabase context:\\n\\n> You are a very enthusiastic Supabase representative who loves to help people. Given the following sections from the Supabase documentation, answer the question using only that information. Output it in markdown format. If you\'re unsure and the answer is not explicitly written in the documentation, say \\"sorry, I don\'t know how to help with that\\".\\n>\\n> Context sections:\\n> {{context text placeholder}}\\n>\\n> Question: \\"\\"\\"\\n> {{question placeholder}}\\n> \\"\\"\\"\\n>\\n> Answer as markdown, including related code snippets if available.\\n\\nIn the shared example, various components were embedded in the prompt:\\n\\n- **Identity**: This sets the stage, providing the model with a role or persona. In the case of the example, the model is given the identity of a \\"very enthusiastic Supabase representative\\". This primes the model for the subsequent tasks and influences its tonality.\\n\\n- **Task**: Explicit instructions for what you want the model to do. This can be as simple as \\"answer the question\\" or more complex, setting boundaries on the type of answer expected.\\n\\n- **Condition**: This safeguards against the model\'s tendencies to \\"hallucinate\\" or generate information that might not be accurate or desired. Setting conditions like \\"if unsure, say \'I don\'t know\'\\" helps in managing the response\'s reliability.\\n\\n- **Context**: By using context injection, we feed the model with information that will guide its answer. In the case of Supabase, it was sections from its documentation.\\n\\n- **Labels**: Labels provide structure. They help clarify sections of the prompt and reinforce the instructions provided in the task.\\n\\n### Safeguarding Against Undesired Responses\\n\\nUsing conditions and context effectively can help in preventing the model from generating undesired outputs. As noted, GPT can sometimes exude overconfidence even in incorrect answers. Setting up conditions like \\"if the answer isn\'t in the documentation, say \'I don\'t know\'\\" is one way to counteract this.\\n\\n### Special Characters and Their Role\\n\\nTriple quotes (`\\"\\"\\"`) around a segment of the prompt, as recommended by OpenAI, can help in explicitly defining the boundaries of a section. It serves a dual purpose \u2013 making it clear to the model and preventing potential prompt injections from malicious actors.\\n\\n### Emphasizing Desired Formatting\\n\\nBy specifying the desired format, like \\"answer as markdown\\", you instruct the model to structure its output in a certain way. This is particularly useful if you\'re looking to display the model\'s output in a specific visual or structural format.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nEngineering your prompts is akin to fine-tuning an already high-performance machine. With the right tweaks, you can go from getting adequate outputs to having a full-fledged, task-smashing assistant.\\n\\n> **Info:** As an interesting aside\u2014while writing this article and drawing from a specific source (which I\'ve naturally credited), I discovered that others have done the same. However, I took the extra step of omitting the mundane details, refining the examples, and only including what aligns with my own experience. What they did was simply have an AI rewrite the entire text and then repost it without any attribution. This raises ethical questions about intellectual property and the authenticity of the content we consume online. I plan to delve deeper into this issue in a separate blog post.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Prompt Engineering for Effective Interaction with ChatGPT](https://machinelearningmastery.com/prompt-engineering-for-effective-interaction-with-chatgpt/)\\n\\n- [Prompt Engineering Tutorial \u2013 Master ChatGPT and LLM Responses _(Ania Kubow on freeCodeCamp)_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZvnD73m40o)\\n\\n- [ClippyGPT - How I Built Supabase\u2019s OpenAI Doc Search (Embeddings)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yhtjd7yGGGA)"},{"id":"us-encryption-protocols-lagging-a-global-concern","metadata":{"permalink":"/home/blog/us-encryption-protocols-lagging-a-global-concern","editUrl":"https://github.com/scherersebastian/home/blob/main/blog/2023-08-24-us-encryption-protocols-lagging-a-global-concern/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-08-24-us-encryption-protocols-lagging-a-global-concern/index.md","title":"U.S. Encryption Protocols Lagging: A Global Concern","description":"The responsibility of the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is twofold: to define cybersecurity norms and endorse related products.

Alarmingly, they are behind in both areas. As quantum computing threats surface, this delay might lead to an unprecedented crisis.\\n\\nTwo glaring issues stand out: the FIPS 140-3 certification backlog and the slow pace of post-quantum cryptography advancements.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nFIPS 140-3, which outlines encryption standards for a broad range of technologies, is grappling with significant product approval backlogs. If not addressed soon, this lag might become a pivotal crisis, especially with rapid quantum tech developments.\\n\\n## A Brief Dive into FIPS 140-3 Delays\\n\\nStarting its journey in January 1994 with FIPS 140-1, this standard has evolved through collaboration between government and industry stakeholders. FIPS 140-2 was introduced in 2001 and quickly became the foundation for the global standard ISO/IEC 19790:2006 by 2006.\\n\\nFIPS 140-3, introduced in 2019, brought in some modifications. While core encryption methods remained intact, FIPS 140-3 enhanced security assessments across a cryptographic module\'s lifecycle and mandated differentiated administrative roles. Vendors had adjustments to make, primarily at the firmware level.\\n\\nThree years post-launch, a surprising fact is the completion of just seven validations, with a baffling 189 still in the pipeline. The reasons behind these delays, given the modest changes introduced, remain mysterious.\\n\\n## Quantum-Resistant Algorithms: Progress So Far\\n\\nSimultaneously, NIST\'s commitment to developing quantum-resistant cryptographic techniques, initiated in 2016, seems slow. Seven years in, only four algorithms have seen the light of day, with NIST hinting that several are still under review, a process that might span years.\\n\\nThis slow pace is concerning, especially when considering the typical 4-6 year timeframe from standard introduction to product implementation and subsequent market launch.\\n\\nThe crux of the matter is the uncertainty surrounding NIST\'s capability to release these algorithms in a timely manner, ensuring they\'re ready before quantum breakthroughs render current tech obsolete. The rapid advancements in quantum technology, contrasted with NIST\'s slow progress, raise significant concerns.\\n\\nGiven NIST\'s global leadership role in standards and validation, its current trajectory is unsettling. Quantum breakthroughs are becoming commonplace, and major cyber breaches are daily headlines. The looming _harvest now, decrypt later_ quantum threat amplifies these concerns.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIt\'s evident that there\'s a pressing need for robust, futuristic standards and a proactive governing body. Regrettably, both are missing currently. It\'s a hopeful watch as to whether the US Administration\'s Cybersecurity Strategy will offer a solution."},{"id":"low-code-vs-no-code-simplifying-software-development","metadata":{"permalink":"/home/blog/low-code-vs-no-code-simplifying-software-development","editUrl":"https://github.com/scherersebastian/home/blob/main/blog/2022-04-17-low-code-vs-no-code-simplifying-software-development/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-04-17-low-code-vs-no-code-simplifying-software-development/index.md","title":"Low Code vs. No Code: Simplifying Software Development","description":"Low Code and No Code are both software development approaches aimed at simplifying the development process by reducing the amount of manual coding required.

They enable individuals with little or no programming experience to create applications and automate processes using visual, drag-and-drop interfaces.\\n\\nDespite their similarities, they have some key differences.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n**Low Code**:\\n\\n- Low Code platforms typically require some level of coding knowledge, but they greatly reduce the amount of code that needs to be written manually. They are generally more suitable for professional developers or those with a basic understanding of coding, as they can customize the application with custom code.\\n\\n- They provide visual tools and pre-built components for designing user interfaces, database structures, and logic flows, while still allowing for custom code when needed.\\n\\n- They can handle more complex applications and are more flexible in terms of functionality.\\n\\n**No Code**:\\n\\n- No Code platforms are designed for users with no coding experience, allowing them to create applications by solely using visual tools and pre-built components.\\n\\n- No Code platforms are often used by business users, citizen developers, and non-technical users like PHP developers who need to create simple applications or automate processes without any programming knowledge.\\n\\n- They are generally more limited in terms of functionality and complexity compared to Low Code platforms, making them more suitable for simpler applications and projects.\\n\\nIn summary, Low Code and No Code platforms both aim to simplify the software development process, but Low Code platforms require some level of coding knowledge and are more flexible, while No Code platforms are completely visual and designed for non-technical users.\\n\\n## Use Cases\\n\\nThey help organizations accelerate digital transformation, improve efficiency, and empower non-technical users to create custom solutions. Some common use cases include:\\n\\n- Rapid application development: Both Low Code and No Code platforms enable organizations to quickly develop and deploy applications, reducing the time and resources required for traditional software development.\\n\\n- Business process automation: Companies use these platforms to automate repetitive tasks and streamline workflows, increasing efficiency and reducing the chances of human error.\\n\\n- Citizen development: By empowering non-technical users to create applications, these platforms help bridge the gap between IT and business teams, fostering innovation and collaboration.\\n\\n- Prototyping and validation: Companies can use these platforms to quickly develop prototypes and validate ideas, helping them make informed decisions about product development and investments.\\n\\n- Digital transformation: Low Code and No Code platforms help organizations adapt to the ever-changing digital landscape by enabling them to develop and deploy custom solutions quickly and cost-effectively.\\n\\nExamples of popular Low Code and No Code platforms include OutSystems, Retool, Appian, Mendix , Wix, Bubble, AppSheet. PowerApps, and Webflow - my personal favorites are Retool and Wix.\\n\\n_These platforms are particularly suitable for internal applications. This is because they do not have to be one hundred percent user-friendly, in contrast to applications that are in contact with customers._\\n\\n## Differentiation from Website Generators\\n\\nWhile No Code platforms and website generators share similarities in their user-friendly, visual interfaces, they differ in terms of scope, capabilities, and intended use cases.\\n\\nHere\'s a comparison of the two:\\n\\nNo Code Platform:\\n\\n- No Code platforms are designed to create a wide variety of applications, including websites, mobile apps, business process automation, and more.\\n\\n- They enable non-technical users to build applications using drag-and-drop elements, visual workflows, and pre-built components without writing any code - _more versatile and flexible than website generators_.\\n\\n- They often include integration capabilities, enabling users to connect their applications to external systems, databases, and APIs.\\n\\nExamples of popular No Code platforms include Bubble, Webflow, and Glide.\\n\\nWebsite Generator:\\n\\n- Website generators focus primarily on creating static or dynamic websites for informational, promotional, or marketing purposes.\\n\\n- They offer pre-built templates and _themes_, making it easy for users to design and launch websites with minimal technical expertise.\\n\\n- They may have limited customization options and may not support advanced functionalities or integrations as No Code platforms.\\n\\nExamples of popular website generators include WordPress, Wix, Squarespace, and Weebly.\\n\\nIn summary, No Code platforms are more versatile and cater to a broader range of application development use cases, while website generators focus specifically on website creation and management.\\n\\n## Integrations\\n\\nWebsite generators and Low Code platforms often offer integrations with useful tools, as well as other third-party services and APIs. These integrations help users extend the functionality of their websites or applications and connect with external systems and services.\\n\\nMany website generators provide built-in support for integrating with Google Analytics and other popular tools, such as social media platforms, email marketing services, and e-commerce solutions.\\n\\nLow Code platforms also support integrations with a wide range of external tools and services, including Google Analytics, CRM systems, databases, and APIs. These integrations can be added through pre-built connectors, custom code, or by leveraging APIs provided by the respective services.\\n\\n_This is extremely useful, as you don\'t need to know every last detail of every single technology behind the integration._\\n\\n## Some Drawbacks\\n\\nWhile Low Code, No Code and website generator platforms offer numerous benefits, they also have some drawbacks. Some of the most significant drawbacks include:\\n\\n- Limited customization and flexibility\\n\\n- _Vendor lock-in_ and platform dependency: When using a Low Code or No Code platform, users become reliant on the vendor\'s infrastructure, tools, and services - it\'s a _platform_. If the vendor changes pricing, discontinues certain features, or ceases operations, users might face challenges in migrating their applications to another platform or maintaining their current solutions.\\n\\n- Security: Relying on third-party platforms might introduce potential vulnerabilities or challenges in meeting specific security requirements.\\n\\n- Learning curve: Although these platforms are designed to be user-friendly, there can still be a learning curve involved in mastering their features and understanding their limitations.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nDespite these drawbacks, Low Code and No Code platforms can be valuable tools for organizations looking to accelerate application development, empower non-technical users, and reduce development costs. It is essential to consider these limitations when evaluating whether a Low Code or No Code platform is the right fit for a specific project or organization."}]}')}}]);
