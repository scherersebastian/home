Integrated into your code editor, this chatbot enhances the already impressive GitHub Copilot. Its revolutionary aspect lies in increased interactivity, allowing for nuanced communication with AI. Currently in beta, it\'s available for enterprise customers using Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## More Than Just a Code Generator\\n\\nWhile GitHub Copilot already offers code suggestions, Copilot Chat takes AI interaction up a notch by enabling real-time dialogue. Instead of just generating code, you can now discuss it, ask follow-up questions, and request explanations. The full chat history is saved, aiding in context retention and deeper code understanding.\\n\\n## Context-Aware Code Suggestions for Enhanced Productivity\\n\\nGitHub Copilot Chat is unique in its real-time, context-aware capabilities. It\'s _\\"more than just a chat window,\\"_ offering tailored programming support, real-time advice, security fixes, and code analysis.\\n\\nThe example below performs a security code review with GitHub CoPilot Chat for a Dockerfile.\\n\\n```plaintext\\nPerform a security code review for the selected code, consider known security rules related to container security.\\n```\\n\\n![Dockerfile Security Code Reivew](assets/Screenshot_from_2023-09-11_19-21-02.png)\\n\\nThe Dockerfile configures the root user which is a security risk, as a compromised container could potentially endanger the host server or other containers. This also contradicts the principle of least privilege, which states that software should run with the minimal necessary permissions to minimize potential security risks. Additionally, containers running as root can make unintended and potentially harmful changes to the system.\\n\\nNow you can ask Copilot Chat why this was not listed in the security code review.\\n\\n```plaintext\\nWhy don\'t you say anything about the root user?\\n```\\n\\n![Dockerfile Security Code Reivew No Root](assets/Screenshot_from_2023-09-12_21-42-42.png)\\n\\n## Limited Scope\\n\\nDespite its strengths, GitHub Copilot Chat has limitations. It struggles with complex code structures and less common languages, and suggestion quality varies based on the language\'s representation in the training data. The tool is not designed to tackle overarching design or architecture issues.\\n\\nAdditionally, Copilot and Copilot Chat can only process individual files or code snippets, limited to around 2000 tokens. However, this cap is expected to increase in future versions.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nTo wrap it up, GitHub Copilot Chat is a game-changer. It\'s not just about spitting out code; it lets you have a real conversation with the AI to dig deeper into your code issues. Sure, it\'s got some limits, like not being great with obscure languages and not handling an entire repo.

No, I don\'t mean saying _please_ and _thank you_ \u2014 I\'m talking about mastering the art of prompt engineering.\\n\\nPrompt engineering is not straightforward; it requires careful thought and various considerations.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## The Principles of Prompting: The Basics\\n\\nAlright, before we get into the nitty-gritty techniques, let\'s set the stage with some principles.\\n\\n- Write **clear, detailed** instructions.\\n\\n- Specify the **format**, like summaries, lists, or bullet points.\\n\\n- Use **system messages and role-playing** to enhance the interaction.\\n\\n- Limit **scope** for broad topics.\\n\\n- Avoid leading the model to a specific answer.\\n\\n**Instead of:**\\n\\n```plaintext\\nWrite 5 tech articles.\\n```\\n\\n**A well-engineered prompt would look like:**\\n\\n```plaintext\\nGenerate titles and abstracts for 5 tech articles focusing on the impact of machine learning on healthcare. Each abstract should be around 100-150 words. Aim for topics that would be relevant for CTOs of healthcare startups. Output the results as a numbered list.\\n```\\n\\nHere, the revised prompt leaves no room for misinterpretation. It clearly specifies the number of articles, the subject focus (machine learning in healthcare), the target audience (CTOs of healthcare startups), and even the format in which the output should be presented. The more specific you are, the more accurate and tailored the output will be.\\n\\n## Prompt Wording\\n\\nThe way you phrase your prompt is crucial for getting the output you want from a language learning model like ChatGPT. The model needs clear and accurate language to deliver useful answers. If you\'re not sure about the terminology in a particular field, this could limit the quality of the model\'s responses\u2014think of it like doing a web search with the wrong keywords.\\n\\nEssentially, prompt wording isn\'t a standalone method but serves as the backbone for all other prompting techniques.\\n\\n_Sorry PHP developers, you still have to learn a new proper language._\\n\\n## Prompt Engineering Strategies\\n\\n### Input/Output Prompting\\n\\nThe elementary method of asking and receiving.\\n\\nInstead of:\\n\\n```plaintext\\nTranslate the following text into French.\\n```\\n\\nSay:\\n\\n```plaintext\\nTranslate the following English text into French: \\"The weather is fine.\\"\\n```\\n\\nClarity is king. Specificity leads to more accurate outputs.\\n\\n### Zero-Shot, One-Shot, and Few-Shot Prompting\\n\\nZero-Shot is like throwing a dart in the dark; One-Shot and Few-Shot light up the board.\\n\\n```plaintext\\nZero-Shot: Recommend some video games.\\nOne-Shot: Recommend video games similar to \\"Animal Crossing.\\"\\nFew-Shot: Recommend video games based on my liking for \\"Animal Crossing,\\" \\"Stardew Valley,\\" and \\"Harvest Moon.\\"\\n```\\n\\nYour level of specificity dictates the relevance of the recommendations.\\n\\nZero-shot uses the model\'s existing training to answer queries without additional data. Few-shot prompting uses limited additional examples to guide the model to a desired output. For example, specifying personal preferences like \\"Ania\'s favorite foods are burgers, fries, and pizza\\" can help the model give restaurant recommendations in a location like Dubai.\\n\\n### Chain-of-Thought Prompting\\n\\nFor problems that require more brainpower, guide the model through a logical progression.\\n\\n```plaintext\\nHow would you optimize a bubble sort algorithm for efficiency? Think this through step by step.\\n```\\n\\nThis will make the model break down the problem logically, perhaps suggesting using a different sorting algorithm altogether.\\n\\n### Self-Criticism\\n\\nMachines aren\'t perfect. Teach the LLM to critique its work for increased accuracy.\\n\\n```plaintext\\nReview the SQL query you just generated. Does it follow best practices? If not, please rewrite it.\\n```\\n\\nThis will get the model to scrutinize its own output, allowing you to catch and correct errors proactively.\\n\\n### Iterative Prompting\\n\\nBig problems? Break \'em down into digestible pieces and solve them one at a time.\\n\\nYou could first ask for a list of top cybersecurity threats for 2023, then inquire about mitigation strategies for each. Baby steps will get you there.\\n\\n### Prompting for Prompts\\n\\nHave ChatGPT help you ask better questions. For example:\\n\\n```plaintext\\nWhat kind of prompt would help you generate a more efficient sorting algorithm?\\n```\\n\\n### Model-Guided Prompting\\n\\nChatGPT can ask you for the info it needs to perform a specific task.\\n\\n```plaintext\\nDevelop a machine learning model for sentiment analysis. What do you need to know from me?\\n```\\n\\nThis eliminates guesswork and leads to a more customized output.\\n\\n## AI Hallucinations\\n\\nIn the realm of prompt engineering with language models like GPT-4, one phenomenon that can\'t be ignored is that of AI hallucinations. Simply put, an AI hallucination occurs when the model outputs data that is either blatantly incorrect or unusually distorted, often due to the misinterpretation of the input prompt or the underlying training data.\\n\\nIn machine learning, a model\'s ability to generalize from its training data to unseen data is crucial. However, sometimes this generalization goes awry. The model might extrapolate from its training in ways that, while mathematically plausible given its training set, are practically nonsensical or misleading.\\n\\nGoogle\'s Deep Dream serves as a quintessential example in the image domain, transforming benign pictures into nightmarish arrays of repetitive patterns. While entertaining in the context of art, hallucinations can become problematic when we rely on the model for mission-critical tasks such as medical diagnosis, financial analysis, or autonomous vehicle control.\\n\\n### Mitigating the Risk\\n\\nThere are several ways to detect and mitigate the risks of AI hallucinations:\\n\\n1. Data Quality: Ensure that the model is trained on high-quality, unbiased data.\\n\\n2. Model Auditing: Regularly evaluate the model\'s output in different scenarios to identify any erratic behavior.\\n\\n3. Output Validation: Include a layer of human oversight or automated checks to validate the model\'s output against known parameters or ground truth.\\n\\n### Best Practice: Review Your Outputs\\n\\nIt\'s essential to critically review any machine-generated output, particularly in contexts where an incorrect response can have significant ramifications.\\n\\nBy understanding the mechanics and pitfalls of AI hallucinations, engineers can better anticipate these anomalies and put measures in place to prevent or catch them, thereby ensuring more robust and reliable machine learning implementations.\\n\\n## Text Embeddings\\n\\nText embeddings convert textual data into high-dimensional vectors that capture semantic meaning, serving as the backbone of any natural language processing (NLP) based application.\\n\\nUnderstanding textual data is essential for companies that deal with customer interactions, analytics, or decision-making based on textual information. Text embeddings can supercharge applications like customer service chatbots, sentiment analysis tools, or search engines to offer accurate and contextually relevant results.\\n\\nImagine a chatbot integrated into Mercedes\' online showroom platform, designed to help potential customers with their car-buying experience. A customer might ask, _\\"Tell me about the fuel efficiency of the E-Class.\\"_ Another might inquire, _\\"What\'s the gas mileage on the E-Class sedan?\\"_\\n\\nBy leveraging text embeddings, the chatbot can understand that \\"fuel efficiency\\" and \\"gas mileage\\" are semantically similar queries, even though the wording is different. These terms are converted into high-dimensional vectors that cluster closely in the semantic space, allowing the chatbot to recognize them as related.\\n\\nWith this capability, the chatbot can provide detailed and relevant information to potential buyers, enhancing the customer experience and possibly accelerating the sales process. This is particularly important for a premium brand like Mercedes, where customers expect high levels of personalized service. Text embeddings make the chatbot more adaptable and efficient, which is crucial for a luxury automaker aiming to offer a customer experience as polished as the cars it sells.\\n\\nIn summary, text embeddings are vital for companies seeking to leverage NLP in targeted applications, offering superior understanding and performance compared to traditional lexical methods.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nEngineering your prompts is akin to fine-tuning an already high-performance machine. With the right tweaks, you can go from getting adequate outputs to having a full-fledged, task-smashing assistant.\\n\\n> **Info:** As an interesting aside\u2014while writing this article and drawing from a specific source (which I\'ve naturally credited), I discovered that others have done the same. However, I took the extra step of omitting the mundane details, refining the examples, and only including what aligns with my own experience. What they did was simply have an AI rewrite the entire text and then repost it without any attribution. This raises ethical questions about intellectual property and the authenticity of the content we consume online. I plan to delve deeper into this issue in a separate blog post.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Prompt Engineering for Effective Interaction with ChatGPT](https://machinelearningmastery.com/prompt-engineering-for-effective-interaction-with-chatgpt/)\\n\\n- [Prompt Engineering Tutorial \u2013 Master ChatGPT and LLM Responses _(Ania Kubow on freeCodeCamp)_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZvnD73m40o)"}]}')}}]);
