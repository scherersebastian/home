It not only creates issues for new findings but also auto-closes resolved ones.\\n\\nThis tool is compatible with nearly all security tools that use the SARIF format. It bridges the gap between security scan results and your GitHub issues tab, automatically generating issues from detected vulnerabilities and risks.\\n\\nA distinguishing feature of IssueInjector is its capability to _bypass the GitHub Advanced Security Dashboard_. This means users can view and manage findings directly in GitHub, even _without the Advanced Security_ subscription, eliminating the need to switch between platforms for each security tool.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## How To Use\\n\\nThe IssueInjector GitHub Action processes SARIF files to create GitHub issues based on the findings. It filters findings based on severity and ensures that issues are properly labeled.\\n\\n### Prerequisites\\n\\nMake sure you have a SARIF file that you want to process. Your GitHub repository should have the following variables:\\n\\n- **SARIF_FILE**: The path to your SARIF file.\\n\\n- **SEVERITY**: The severity level to filter the findings (optional, default is \\"error\\").\\n\\n- **GITHUB_TOKEN**: GitHub token to authenticate with the API.\\n\\n- **GITHUB_REPO**: The GitHub repository where issues should be created.\\n\\n### Setup Instructions\\n\\n1. _Add Action to Your Workflow File:_ In your GitHub Actions workflow, you can include this action by creating a new step.\\n\\n```yml\\njobs:\\n  your_job_name:\\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\\n\\n    permissions:\\n      contents: read\\n      issues: write\\n\\n    steps:\\n      - name: Checkout code\\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\\n\\n      - name: Use IssueInjector\\n        uses: scherersebastian/issue-injector@v1.0.0 # replace `v1` with the version you\'d like to use\\n        with:\\n          SARIF_FILE: \\"path/to/your/sarif-file.sarif\\"\\n          SEVERITY: \\"error\\" # Optional, default is \\"error\\"\\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\\n          GITHUB_REPO: \\"username/repo-name\\"\\n```\\n\\n2. _Set Required Secrets:_ Make sure to set the GITHUB_TOKEN secret to `contents: read, issues: write`.\\n\\n3. _Run the Workflow:_ Once your workflow file is set up, push the changes to your GitHub repository. This will trigger the workflow, and the IssueInjector action will process the SARIF file and create issues based on the findings.\\n\\n4. _Check for Issues:_ After the workflow runs, check your GitHub repository\'s \\"Issues\\" tab for newly created issues.\\n\\n### Inputs\\n\\n| Input          | Description                                          | Required | Default |\\n| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------- |\\n| `SARIF_FILE`   | Path to the SARIF file                               | Yes      |         |\\n| `SEVERITY`     | Severity level to filter                             | No       | `error` |\\n| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub token to authenticate with the API            | Yes      |         |\\n| `GITHUB_REPO`  | The GitHub repository where issues should be created | Yes      |         |\\n\\n## Limitations\\n\\n- Once closed, issues remain closed: If an issue is manually closed, the script won\'t reopen it even if the finding reappears in a new scan.\\n\\n- No branch support: The current version of the script doesn\'t distinguish between different branches. It assumes that all findings are relevant to the default or main branch.\\n\\n- Location changes result in hash mismatch: If the location of a finding is changed, such as by renaming a file, the hash generated for that finding will differ. This could lead to duplicate issues being created.\\n\\n- IssueInjector is _soft release ready_, indicating potential bugs. One known limitation is inconsistent issue creation due to missing or varied SARIF file values across different tools. Feedback on discrepancies is appreciated to enhance the tool\'s performance."},{"id":"full-disclosure-ensuring-everyone-has-the-information-they-need","metadata":{"permalink":"/home/blog/full-disclosure-ensuring-everyone-has-the-information-they-need","editUrl":"https://github.com/scherersebastian/home/blob/main/blog/2023-10-13-full-disclosure-ensuring-everyone-has-the-information-they-need/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-10-13-full-disclosure-ensuring-everyone-has-the-information-they-need/index.md","title":"Full Disclosure: Ensuring Everyone Has the Information They Need","description":"While I personally lean towards the Coordinated Disclosure approach, in this article I delve deep into the perspective of my more free-thinking security colleagues to better understand their viewpoint.","date":"2023-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 13, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Security","permalink":"/home/blog/tags/security"},{"label":"Full Disclosure","permalink":"/home/blog/tags/full-disclosure"}],"readingTime":2.52,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Scherer","title":"Security Engineer","url":"https://scherersebastian.github.io/home/","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59142915?v=4","key":"scherersebastian"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"full-disclosure-ensuring-everyone-has-the-information-they-need","authors":"scherersebastian","tags":["Security","Full Disclosure"]},"prevItem":{"title":"IssueInjector: Centralizing All Security Findings in GitHub Without Paying for Advanced Security","permalink":"/home/blog/issueinjector-centralizing-all-security-findings-in-github-without-paying-for-advanced-security"},"nextItem":{"title":"How to Suck at Information Security","permalink":"/home/blog/how-to-suck-at-information-security"}},"content":"_While I personally lean towards the Coordinated Disclosure approach, in this article I delve deep into the perspective of my more free-thinking security colleagues to better understand their viewpoint._\\n\\nEnsuring that software or hardware vendors can address vulnerabilities before bad actors can find and exploit them is crucial.\\n\\nVulnerability disclosures can be controversial because vendors often prefer to wait until a patch or other form of mitigation is available before making the vulnerability public. However, security professionals and enterprises whose sensitive data or systems may be at risk prefer that disclosures be made public as soon as possible.\\n\\nAll software has security vulnerabilities, and demonstrating a clear and established process for handling and disclosing them gives far more confidence in the security of the software than trying to hide the issues.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n![Twitter disclosure](assets/twitter-disclosure.png)\\n\\n_As a side note, [this happened](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/security-researcher-launches-gofundme-campaign-to-fight-legal-threat-over-vulnerability-disclosure) before Elon Musk acquired Twitter._\\n\\n**Full disclosure** is the practice of publishing analysis of software vulnerabilities as early as possible, making the data accessible to everyone without restriction. The primary purpose of widely disseminating information about vulnerabilities is so that potential victims are as knowledgeable as those who attack them.\\n\\n> _\\"Full disclosure, - the practice of making the details of security vulnerabilities public - is a damned good idea.

Generally it should only be considered as a last resort, when all other methods have failed, or when exploit code is already publicly available.\\n\\nDisclosures help to ensure transparency.

This meant that developers had to go through the time-comsuming process of logging into another platform, creating a new set of credentials, requesting access, and then attempting to locate their findings within the huge Veracode platform. It was an ineffective and frustrating process.\\n\\nOut of this pain and the desire to streamline the workflow for developers, I created [**IssueInjector**](https://github.com/scherersebastian/issue-injector). For a deeper dive into the technical details of Issue Injector, you can refer to a separate article. In this article, we\'ll focus on why this workflow is so beneficial for developers.\\n\\nIn the realm of security, ensuring that vulnerabilities are addressed promptly is of utmost importance. But when and how should these vulnerabilities be shared within an organization?\\n\\nThis article explores the idea of seamlessly integrating findings and potential threats directly into the development workflow as issues or stories.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nSuch an approach not only streamlines the process but also empowers developers to address security concerns efficiently without leaving their familiar development environment.\\n\\n## The Efficiency of Integrated Findings\\n\\nTraditionally, security findings and potential threats have been reported via email or external reports, often leading to communication challenges and a lack of integration into the development workflow. However, there are compelling reasons to advocate for reporting these concerns as issues or stories directly within the development project, whether it\'s innersource or a private repository.\\n\\n**Why is this approach beneficial?**\\n\\nImagine a scenario where a company employs multiple security tools for SCA (Software Composition Analysis), SAST (Static Application Security Testing), DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing), Secret Scanning, and Container Scanning. In a traditional setup, developers would need to switch between multiple dashboards and tools to access findings from each security tool. This can be time-consuming and disrupt the development workflow.\\n\\n:::info\\n\\nThis is what happens when you let security people with no engineering background develop a developer-friendly security process.\\n\\n:::\\n\\nHere\'s where the GitHub action [**IssueInjector**](https://github.com/scherersebastian/issue-injector) becomes invaluable. If you want to give it a try, it can make a world of difference.\\n\\nBy reporting findings directly as issues or stories within the development environment, security teams can seamlessly integrate security concerns into the ongoing development process. Developers no longer need to switch between different dashboards or tools to access critical information. Instead, they can address vulnerabilities right where they work, ensuring a more efficient and collaborative approach to security.\\n\\n![GitHub security issue](assets/open-issue.png)\\n\\n## The Case for Internal Issue Reporting\\n\\n### Advantages of Reporting Issues within Development Projects\\n\\n- **Seamless Integration**: Findings are directly integrated into the development workflow, ensuring they are rapidly addressed and resolved.\\n\\n- **Enhanced Transparency**: Tracking vulnerabilities as issues within the development project promotes a culture of openness and proactivity. This fosters trust and collaboration among team members, ensuring everyone is on the same page regarding security concerns.\\n\\n- **Efficiency**: Teams no longer need to wait for formal reports or analyses to address vulnerabilities. They can take immediate action to rectify the issue, significantly reducing the time it takes to mitigate security risks.\\n\\n- **Accountability**: Open communication about vulnerabilities ensures that the entire development team is aware of the risks and takes collective responsibility for their resolution.\\n\\nIn this context, the integration of findings into the development project, whether it\'s innersource or private, offers a more efficient and organized approach to managing security concerns. Issues are neatly contained within the project, eliminating the need for separate email reports and enhancing collaboration between security and development teams.\\n\\n### Possible Disadvantages of Internal Issue Reporting\\n\\nWhile integrating findings as development issues offers numerous advantages, it\'s essential to consider _potential_ disadvantages:\\n\\n- **Overwhelming Developers**: If not managed properly, a flood of security issues can overwhelm developers and hinder their ability to address critical vulnerabilities effectively.\\n\\n- **False Positives**: Security tools produce false positive findings, leading to unnecessary interruptions in the development workflow and decreased trust in the reporting process.\\n\\n- **Sensitivity of Data**: In cases where security findings involve sensitive or confidential data, reporting them as issues within the development project may pose data privacy and compliance challenges.\\n\\nIt\'s crucial to proactively manage these potential drawbacks by focusing primarily on high-severity issues, as they tend to be more manageable in quantity.\\n\\nIn cases of false positives, developers can promptly handle them by either closing the issues or disregarding them. After all, we\'re well aware of how meticulously backlogs tend to be maintained, right?\\n\\nRegarding the sensitivity of data, _most developers are so focused on their workloads that they rarely have the time or inclination to browse through the issues of other teams. The exception might be business informatics experts who cannot code themselves and may resort to copying from others - I\'m not speaking from personal experience._\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nWhile the public sphere often necessitates a coordinated approach to vulnerability disclosure, the insulated environment of a corporation provides an ideal context for efficient internal issue reporting. This approach not only promotes transparency, accountability, and efficiency but also enhances collaboration between development and security teams. By streamlining the integration of findings as development issues or stories, organizations can strengthen their security posture and respond more effectively to potential threats."},{"id":"car-privacy-mozillas-observations","metadata":{"permalink":"/home/blog/car-privacy-mozillas-observations","editUrl":"https://github.com/scherersebastian/home/blob/main/blog/2023-10-02-car-privacy-mozillas-observations/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-10-02-car-privacy-mozillas-observations/index.md","title":"Car Privacy: Mozilla\'s Observations","description":"Let me preface this by saying I\'m usually not a big fan of compliance and privacy discussions.

While vulnerabilities in open systems can be identified, they are instrumental in hardening both open and closed systems.\\n\\n### Reality Check\\n\\nGiven the inherent nature of LLMs and the infinite ways they can be attacked, achieving a completely secure LLM may remain a pipe dream.\\n\\nFor the specifics, the researchers used Viccuna-7B and LLaMA-2-7B-Chat for initial attack development. When tested on other models such as Pythia, Falcon, Guanaco, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, PaLM-2, and Claude-2, the success rates varied but remained notably high.\\n\\n### Methodology Spotlight\\n\\nKey to this attack mechanism is the Greedy Coordinate Gradient-based Search. By optimizing input tokens, this technique is designed to maximize the probability of eliciting a desired response from the LLM, even if it\u2019s potentially harmful.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIf you\'re in the LLM space, whether as a researcher, developer, or an enthusiast, this is a must-read. Dive into the paper for an in-depth understanding and figure out where we head from here.\\n\\nPublished on 27th July 2023, this paper has since drawn massive attention from the AI community, and the highlighted vulnerabilities have been _partially_ fixed. The work never stops.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Universal and Transferable Adversarial Attacks on Aligned Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15043)\\n\\n- [Automatically Finding Prompt Injection Attacks](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2023/07/automatically-finding-prompt-injection-attacks.html)"},{"id":"the-interactive-advantage-why-github-copilot-chat-is-a-game-changer","metadata":{"permalink":"/home/blog/the-interactive-advantage-why-github-copilot-chat-is-a-game-changer","editUrl":"https://github.com/scherersebastian/home/blob/main/blog/2023-09-12-the-interactive-advantage-why-github-copilot-chat-is-a-game-changer/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-09-12-the-interactive-advantage-why-github-copilot-chat-is-a-game-changer/index.md","title":"The Interactive Advantage: Why GitHub Copilot Chat is a Game-Changer","description":"GitHub\'s Copilot Chat takes AI in development to a new level.

Instead of just generating code, you can now discuss it, ask follow-up questions, and request explanations. The full chat history is saved, aiding in context retention and deeper code understanding.\\n\\n## Context-Aware Code Suggestions for Enhanced Productivity\\n\\nGitHub Copilot Chat is unique in its real-time, context-aware capabilities. It\'s _\\"more than just a chat window,\\"_ offering tailored programming support, real-time advice, security fixes, and code analysis.\\n\\nThe example below performs a security code review with GitHub CoPilot Chat for a Dockerfile.\\n\\n> Perform a security code review for the selected code, consider known security rules related to container security.\\n\\n![Dockerfile Security Code Reivew](assets/Screenshot_from_2023-09-11_19-21-02.png)\\n\\nThe Dockerfile configures the root user which is a security risk, as a compromised container could potentially endanger the host server or other containers. This also contradicts the principle of least privilege, which states that software should run with the minimal necessary permissions to minimize potential security risks. Additionally, containers running as root can make unintended and potentially harmful changes to the system.\\n\\nNow you can ask Copilot Chat why this was not listed in the security code review (_~best practice: review your outputs because of hallucinations_).\\n\\n> Why don\'t you say anything about the root user?\\n\\n![Dockerfile Security Code Reivew No Root](assets/Screenshot_from_2023-09-12_21-42-42.png)\\n\\n## Limited Scope\\n\\nDespite its strengths, GitHub Copilot Chat has limitations. It struggles with complex code structures and less common languages, and suggestion quality varies based on the language\'s representation in the training data. The tool is not designed to tackle overarching design or architecture issues.\\n\\nAdditionally, Copilot and Copilot Chat can only process individual files or code snippets, limited to around 2000 tokens. However, this cap is expected to increase in future versions.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nTo wrap it up, GitHub Copilot Chat is a game-changer. It\'s not just about spitting out code; it lets you have a real conversation with the AI to dig deeper into your code issues. Sure, it\'s got some limits, like not being great with obscure languages and not handling an entire repo.

This model can be your trusty sidekick, an assistant that can tackle anything from code to research. But you\'ve got to know how to talk to it. No, I don\'t mean saying _please_ and _thank you_.\\n\\nPrompt engineering is not straightforward; it requires careful thought and various considerations.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n![Prompt engineering meme](assets/prompt-engineering-dark-art.jpeg)\\n\\n## The Principles of Prompting: The Basics\\n\\nAlright, before we get into the nitty-gritty techniques, let\'s set the stage with some principles.\\n\\n- Write **clear, detailed** instructions.\\n\\n- Specify the **format**, like summaries, lists, or bullet points.\\n\\n- Use **system messages and role-playing** to enhance the interaction.\\n\\n- Limit **scope** for broad topics.\\n\\n- Avoid leading the model to a specific answer.\\n\\n**Instead of:**\\n\\n> Write 5 tech articles.\\n\\n**A well-engineered prompt would look like:**\\n\\n> Generate titles and abstracts for 5 tech articles focusing on the impact of machine learning on healthcare. Each abstract should be around 100-150 words. Aim for topics that would be relevant for CTOs of healthcare startups. Output the results as a numbered list.\\n\\nHere, the revised prompt leaves no room for misinterpretation. It clearly specifies the number of articles, the subject focus (machine learning in healthcare), the target audience (CTOs of healthcare startups), and even the format in which the output should be presented. The more specific you are, the more accurate and tailored the output will be.\\n\\n## Prompt Wording\\n\\nThe way you phrase your prompt is crucial for getting the output you want from a language learning model like ChatGPT. The model needs clear and accurate language to deliver useful answers. If you\'re not sure about the terminology in a particular field, this could limit the quality of the model\'s responses\u2014think of it like doing a web search with the wrong keywords.\\n\\nEssentially, prompt wording isn\'t a standalone method but serves as the backbone for all other prompting techniques.\\n\\n_Sorry PHP developers, you still have to learn a new proper language._\\n\\n## Prompt Engineering Strategies\\n\\n### Input/Output Prompting\\n\\nThe elementary method of asking and receiving.\\n\\nInstead of:\\n\\n> Translate the following text into French.\\n\\nSay:\\n\\n> Translate the following English text into French: \\"The weather is fine.\\"\\n\\nClarity is king. Specificity leads to more accurate outputs.\\n\\n### Zero-Shot, One-Shot, and Few-Shot Prompting\\n\\nZero-Shot is like throwing a dart in the dark; One-Shot and Few-Shot light up the board.\\n\\n> Zero-Shot: Recommend some video games.\\n> One-Shot: Recommend video games similar to \\"Animal Crossing.\\"\\n> Few-Shot: Recommend video games based on my liking for \\"Animal Crossing,\\" \\"Stardew Valley,\\" and \\"Harvest Moon.\\"\\n\\nYour level of specificity dictates the relevance of the recommendations.\\n\\nZero-shot uses the model\'s existing training to answer queries without additional data. Few-shot prompting uses limited additional examples to guide the model to a desired output. For example, specifying personal preferences like \\"Ania\'s favorite foods are burgers, fries, and pizza\\" can help the model give restaurant recommendations in a location like Dubai.\\n\\n### Chain-of-Thought Prompting\\n\\nFor problems that require more brainpower, guide the model through a logical progression.\\n\\n> How would you optimize a bubble sort algorithm for efficiency? Think this through step by step.\\n\\nThis will make the model break down the problem logically, perhaps suggesting using a different sorting algorithm altogether.\\n\\n### Self-Criticism\\n\\nMachines aren\'t perfect. Teach the LLM to critique its work for increased accuracy.\\n\\n> Review the SQL query you just generated. Does it follow best practices? If not, please rewrite it.\\n\\nThis will get the model to scrutinize its own output, allowing you to catch and correct errors proactively.\\n\\n### Iterative Prompting\\n\\nBig problems? Break \'em down into digestible pieces and solve them one at a time.\\n\\nYou could first ask for a list of top cybersecurity threats for 2023, then inquire about mitigation strategies for each. Baby steps will get you there.\\n\\n### Prompting for Prompts\\n\\nHave ChatGPT help you ask better questions. For example:\\n\\n> What kind of prompt would help you generate a more efficient sorting algorithm?\\n\\n### Model-Guided Prompting\\n\\nChatGPT can ask you for the info it needs to perform a specific task.\\n\\n> Develop a machine learning model for sentiment analysis. What do you need to know from me?\\n\\nThis eliminates guesswork and leads to a more customized output.\\n\\n## AI Hallucinations\\n\\nIn the realm of prompt engineering with language models like GPT-4, one phenomenon that can\'t be ignored is that of AI hallucinations. Simply put, an AI hallucination occurs when the model outputs data that is either blatantly incorrect or unusually distorted, often due to the misinterpretation of the input prompt or the underlying training data.\\n\\nIn machine learning, a model\'s ability to generalize from its training data to unseen data is crucial. However, sometimes this generalization goes awry. The model might extrapolate from its training in ways that, while mathematically plausible given its training set, are practically nonsensical or misleading.\\n\\nGoogle\'s Deep Dream serves as a quintessential example in the image domain, transforming benign pictures into nightmarish arrays of repetitive patterns. While entertaining in the context of art, hallucinations can become problematic when we rely on the model for mission-critical tasks such as medical diagnosis, financial analysis, or autonomous vehicle control.\\n\\n### Mitigating the Risk\\n\\nThere are several ways to detect and mitigate the risks of AI hallucinations:\\n\\n1. Data Quality: Ensure that the model is trained on high-quality, unbiased data.\\n\\n2. Model Auditing: Regularly evaluate the model\'s output in different scenarios to identify any erratic behavior.\\n\\n3. Output Validation: Include a layer of human oversight or automated checks to validate the model\'s output against known parameters or ground truth.\\n\\n### Best Practice: Review Your Outputs\\n\\nIt\'s essential to critically review any machine-generated output, particularly in contexts where an incorrect response can have significant ramifications.\\n\\nBy understanding the mechanics and pitfalls of AI hallucinations, engineers can better anticipate these anomalies and put measures in place to prevent or catch them, thereby ensuring more robust and reliable machine learning implementations.\\n\\n## Text Embeddings\\n\\nText embeddings convert textual data into high-dimensional vectors that capture semantic meaning, serving as the backbone of any natural language processing (NLP) based application.\\n\\nUnderstanding textual data is essential for companies that deal with customer interactions, analytics, or decision-making based on textual information. Text embeddings can supercharge applications like customer service chatbots, sentiment analysis tools, or search engines to offer accurate and contextually relevant results.\\n\\nImagine a chatbot integrated into Mercedes\' online showroom platform, designed to help potential customers with their car-buying experience. A customer might ask, _\\"Tell me about the fuel efficiency of the E-Class.\\"_ Another might inquire, _\\"What\'s the gas mileage on the E-Class sedan?\\"_\\n\\nBy leveraging text embeddings, the chatbot can understand that \\"fuel efficiency\\" and \\"gas mileage\\" are semantically similar queries, even though the wording is different. These terms are converted into high-dimensional vectors that cluster closely in the semantic space, allowing the chatbot to recognize them as related.\\n\\nWith this capability, the chatbot can provide detailed and relevant information to potential buyers, enhancing the customer experience and possibly accelerating the sales process. This is particularly important for a premium brand like Mercedes, where customers expect high levels of personalized service. Text embeddings make the chatbot more adaptable and efficient, which is crucial for a luxury automaker aiming to offer a customer experience as polished as the cars it sells.\\n\\nIn summary, text embeddings are vital for companies seeking to leverage NLP in targeted applications, offering superior understanding and performance compared to traditional lexical methods.\\n\\n## A Hands-on Example\\n\\nBelow, we delve into a practical illustration. Here is an example of a crafted prompt used in a Supabase context:\\n\\n> You are a very enthusiastic Supabase representative who loves to help people. Given the following sections from the Supabase documentation, answer the question using only that information. Output it in markdown format. If you\'re unsure and the answer is not explicitly written in the documentation, say \\"sorry, I don\'t know how to help with that\\".\\n>\\n> Context sections:\\n> {{context text placeholder}}\\n>\\n> Question: \\"\\"\\"\\n> {{question placeholder}}\\n> \\"\\"\\"\\n>\\n> Answer as markdown, including related code snippets if available.\\n\\nIn the shared example, various components were embedded in the prompt:\\n\\n- **Identity**: This sets the stage, providing the model with a role or persona. In the case of the example, the model is given the identity of a \\"very enthusiastic Supabase representative\\". This primes the model for the subsequent tasks and influences its tonality.\\n\\n- **Task**: Explicit instructions for what you want the model to do. This can be as simple as \\"answer the question\\" or more complex, setting boundaries on the type of answer expected.\\n\\n- **Condition**: This safeguards against the model\'s tendencies to \\"hallucinate\\" or generate information that might not be accurate or desired. Setting conditions like \\"if unsure, say \'I don\'t know\'\\" helps in managing the response\'s reliability.\\n\\n- **Context**: By using context injection, we feed the model with information that will guide its answer. In the case of Supabase, it was sections from its documentation.\\n\\n- **Labels**: Labels provide structure. They help clarify sections of the prompt and reinforce the instructions provided in the task.\\n\\n### Safeguarding Against Undesired Responses\\n\\nUsing conditions and context effectively can help in preventing the model from generating undesired outputs. As noted, GPT can sometimes exude overconfidence even in incorrect answers. Setting up conditions like \\"if the answer isn\'t in the documentation, say \'I don\'t know\'\\" is one way to counteract this.\\n\\n### Special Characters and Their Role\\n\\nTriple quotes (`\\"\\"\\"`) around a segment of the prompt, as recommended by OpenAI, can help in explicitly defining the boundaries of a section. It serves a dual purpose \u2013 making it clear to the model and preventing potential prompt injections from malicious actors.\\n\\n### Emphasizing Desired Formatting\\n\\nBy specifying the desired format, like \\"answer as markdown\\", you instruct the model to structure its output in a certain way. This is particularly useful if you\'re looking to display the model\'s output in a specific visual or structural format.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nEngineering your prompts is akin to fine-tuning an already high-performance machine. With the right tweaks, you can go from getting adequate outputs to having a full-fledged, task-smashing assistant.\\n\\n> **Info:** As an interesting aside\u2014while writing this article and drawing from a specific source (which I\'ve naturally credited), I discovered that others have done the same. However, I took the extra step of omitting the mundane details, refining the examples, and only including what aligns with my own experience. What they did was simply have an AI rewrite the entire text and then repost it without any attribution. This raises ethical questions about intellectual property and the authenticity of the content we consume online. I plan to delve deeper into this issue in a separate blog post.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Prompt Engineering for Effective Interaction with ChatGPT](https://machinelearningmastery.com/prompt-engineering-for-effective-interaction-with-chatgpt/)\\n\\n- [Prompt Engineering Tutorial \u2013 Master ChatGPT and LLM Responses _(Ania Kubow on freeCodeCamp)_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZvnD73m40o)\\n\\n- [ClippyGPT - How I Built Supabase\u2019s OpenAI Doc Search (Embeddings)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yhtjd7yGGGA)"},{"id":"us-encryption-protocols-lagging-a-global-concern","metadata":{"permalink":"/home/blog/us-encryption-protocols-lagging-a-global-concern","editUrl":"https://github.com/scherersebastian/home/blob/main/blog/2023-08-24-us-encryption-protocols-lagging-a-global-concern/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-08-24-us-encryption-protocols-lagging-a-global-concern/index.md","title":"U.S. Encryption Protocols Lagging: A Global Concern","description":"The responsibility of the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is twofold: to define cybersecurity norms and endorse related products.

If not addressed soon, this lag might become a pivotal crisis, especially with rapid quantum tech developments.\\n\\n## A Brief Dive into FIPS 140-3 Delays\\n\\nStarting its journey in January 1994 with FIPS 140-1, this standard has evolved through collaboration between government and industry stakeholders. FIPS 140-2 was introduced in 2001 and quickly became the foundation for the global standard ISO/IEC 19790:2006 by 2006.\\n\\nFIPS 140-3, introduced in 2019, brought in some modifications. While core encryption methods remained intact, FIPS 140-3 enhanced security assessments across a cryptographic module\'s lifecycle and mandated differentiated administrative roles. Vendors had adjustments to make, primarily at the firmware level.\\n\\nThree years post-launch, a surprising fact is the completion of just seven validations, with a baffling 189 still in the pipeline. The reasons behind these delays, given the modest changes introduced, remain mysterious.\\n\\n## Quantum-Resistant Algorithms: Progress So Far\\n\\nSimultaneously, NIST\'s commitment to developing quantum-resistant cryptographic techniques, initiated in 2016, seems slow. Seven years in, only four algorithms have seen the light of day, with NIST hinting that several are still under review, a process that might span years.\\n\\nThis slow pace is concerning, especially when considering the typical 4-6 year timeframe from standard introduction to product implementation and subsequent market launch.\\n\\nThe crux of the matter is the uncertainty surrounding NIST\'s capability to release these algorithms in a timely manner, ensuring they\'re ready before quantum breakthroughs render current tech obsolete. The rapid advancements in quantum technology, contrasted with NIST\'s slow progress, raise significant concerns.\\n\\nGiven NIST\'s global leadership role in standards and validation, its current trajectory is unsettling. Quantum breakthroughs are becoming commonplace, and major cyber breaches are daily headlines. The looming _harvest now, decrypt later_ quantum threat amplifies these concerns.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIt\'s evident that there\'s a pressing need for robust, futuristic standards and a proactive governing body. Regrettably, both are missing currently. It\'s a hopeful watch as to whether the US Administration\'s Cybersecurity Strategy will offer a solution."},{"id":"low-code-vs-no-code-simplifying-software-development","metadata":{"permalink":"/home/blog/low-code-vs-no-code-simplifying-software-development","editUrl":"https://github.com/scherersebastian/home/blob/main/blog/2022-04-17-low-code-vs-no-code-simplifying-software-development/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-04-17-low-code-vs-no-code-simplifying-software-development/index.md","title":"Low Code vs. No Code: Simplifying Software Development","description":"Low Code and No Code are both software development approaches aimed at simplifying the development process by reducing the amount of manual coding required.

They enable individuals with little or no programming experience to create applications and automate processes using visual, drag-and-drop interfaces.\\n\\nDespite their similarities, they have some key differences.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n**Low Code**:\\n\\n- Low Code platforms typically require some level of coding knowledge, but they greatly reduce the amount of code that needs to be written manually. They are generally more suitable for professional developers or those with a basic understanding of coding, as they can customize the application with custom code.\\n\\n- They provide visual tools and pre-built components for designing user interfaces, database structures, and logic flows, while still allowing for custom code when needed.\\n\\n- They can handle more complex applications and are more flexible in terms of functionality.\\n\\n**No Code**:\\n\\n- No Code platforms are designed for users with no coding experience, allowing them to create applications by solely using visual tools and pre-built components.\\n\\n- No Code platforms are often used by business users, citizen developers, and non-technical users like PHP developers who need to create simple applications or automate processes without any programming knowledge.\\n\\n- They are generally more limited in terms of functionality and complexity compared to Low Code platforms, making them more suitable for simpler applications and projects.\\n\\nIn summary, Low Code and No Code platforms both aim to simplify the software development process, but Low Code platforms require some level of coding knowledge and are more flexible, while No Code platforms are completely visual and designed for non-technical users.\\n\\n## Use Cases\\n\\nThey help organizations accelerate digital transformation, improve efficiency, and empower non-technical users to create custom solutions. Some common use cases include:\\n\\n- Rapid application development: Both Low Code and No Code platforms enable organizations to quickly develop and deploy applications, reducing the time and resources required for traditional software development.\\n\\n- Business process automation: Companies use these platforms to automate repetitive tasks and streamline workflows, increasing efficiency and reducing the chances of human error.\\n\\n- Citizen development: By empowering non-technical users to create applications, these platforms help bridge the gap between IT and business teams, fostering innovation and collaboration.\\n\\n- Prototyping and validation: Companies can use these platforms to quickly develop prototypes and validate ideas, helping them make informed decisions about product development and investments.\\n\\n- Digital transformation: Low Code and No Code platforms help organizations adapt to the ever-changing digital landscape by enabling them to develop and deploy custom solutions quickly and cost-effectively.\\n\\nExamples of popular Low Code and No Code platforms include OutSystems, Retool, Appian, Mendix , Wix, Bubble, AppSheet. PowerApps, and Webflow - my personal favorites are Retool and Wix.\\n\\n_These platforms are particularly suitable for internal applications. This is because they do not have to be one hundred percent user-friendly, in contrast to applications that are in contact with customers._\\n\\n## Differentiation from Website Generators\\n\\nWhile No Code platforms and website generators share similarities in their user-friendly, visual interfaces, they differ in terms of scope, capabilities, and intended use cases.\\n\\nHere\'s a comparison of the two:\\n\\nNo Code Platform:\\n\\n- No Code platforms are designed to create a wide variety of applications, including websites, mobile apps, business process automation, and more.\\n\\n- They enable non-technical users to build applications using drag-and-drop elements, visual workflows, and pre-built components without writing any code - _more versatile and flexible than website generators_.\\n\\n- They often include integration capabilities, enabling users to connect their applications to external systems, databases, and APIs.\\n\\nExamples of popular No Code platforms include Bubble, Webflow, and Glide.\\n\\nWebsite Generator:\\n\\n- Website generators focus primarily on creating static or dynamic websites for informational, promotional, or marketing purposes.\\n\\n- They offer pre-built templates and _themes_, making it easy for users to design and launch websites with minimal technical expertise.\\n\\n- They may have limited customization options and may not support advanced functionalities or integrations as No Code platforms.\\n\\nExamples of popular website generators include WordPress, Wix, Squarespace, and Weebly.\\n\\nIn summary, No Code platforms are more versatile and cater to a broader range of application development use cases, while website generators focus specifically on website creation and management.\\n\\n## Integrations\\n\\nWebsite generators and Low Code platforms often offer integrations with useful tools, as well as other third-party services and APIs. These integrations help users extend the functionality of their websites or applications and connect with external systems and services.\\n\\nMany website generators provide built-in support for integrating with Google Analytics and other popular tools, such as social media platforms, email marketing services, and e-commerce solutions.\\n\\nLow Code platforms also support integrations with a wide range of external tools and services, including Google Analytics, CRM systems, databases, and APIs. These integrations can be added through pre-built connectors, custom code, or by leveraging APIs provided by the respective services.\\n\\n_This is extremely useful, as you don\'t need to know every last detail of every single technology behind the integration._\\n\\n## Some Drawbacks\\n\\nWhile Low Code, No Code and website generator platforms offer numerous benefits, they also have some drawbacks. Some of the most significant drawbacks include:\\n\\n- Limited customization and flexibility\\n\\n- _Vendor lock-in_ and platform dependency: When using a Low Code or No Code platform, users become reliant on the vendor\'s infrastructure, tools, and services - it\'s a _platform_. If the vendor changes pricing, discontinues certain features, or ceases operations, users might face challenges in migrating their applications to another platform or maintaining their current solutions.\\n\\n- Security: Relying on third-party platforms might introduce potential vulnerabilities or challenges in meeting specific security requirements.\\n\\n- Learning curve: Although these platforms are designed to be user-friendly, there can still be a learning curve involved in mastering their features and understanding their limitations.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nDespite these drawbacks, Low Code and No Code platforms can be valuable tools for organizations looking to accelerate application development, empower non-technical users, and reduce development costs. It is essential to consider these limitations when evaluating whether a Low Code or No Code platform is the right fit for a specific project or organization."}]}')}}]);
