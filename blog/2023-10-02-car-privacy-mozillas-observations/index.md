# Car Privacy: Mozilla's Observations

_Let me preface this by saying I'm usually not a big fan of compliance and privacy discussions. They tend to be drab and restrictive in many tech scenarios. But man, this was too amusing to pass up!_

This amusing yet concerning revelation comes courtesy of a [Mozilla study](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/articles/its-official-cars-are-the-worst-product-category-we-have-ever-reviewed-for-privacy/).

Modern cars might be tech marvels, but they're also privacy nightmares. From capturing your musical choices to intimate data points like your health details, these _computers on wheels_ are always watching and listening.

<!--truncate-->

Amusingly (and rather alarmingly), Nissan admits to collecting data about users' _sexual activity_ and _intelligence_ inferred from personal data. They're even open about sharing this with _marketing partners_ or using it for _direct marketing purposes_. It begs the question, Nissan: What marketing genius cooked up this plan? And after your recent data breach, perhaps it's time to rethink these data endeavors?

According to Mozilla, cars are data gluttons, with over 90% of brands offering minimal control to users over their personal data. But the biggest kicker? Amidst all this data frenzy, security protocols are hazy at best.

While these brands don't skimp on voluminous privacy policies, they are eerily silent on whether they adhere to even rudimentary security norms like data encryption.

As a security engineer working for one of the manufacturers mentioned, I've closely reviewed the list of [_Minimum Security Standards_](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/about/methodology/). I can confirm that my employer adheres to all of them. However, it's important to understand that these requirements, as pointed out by Mozilla, are quite minimal.

It is unclear whether the reviewed privacy agreements pertain solely to U.S. contracts or also encompass those from Europe, where data protection regulations are notably stricter.

Drive safe.
