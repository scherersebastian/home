# Understanding Adversarial Attacks on LLMs

If you're elbow-deep in AI research or engineering, this one's a wakeup call. Recent studies have unveiled a new class of vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) – and it’s not just theoretical.

Researchers have published a paper showing how to automate the discovery of prompt injection attacks: [Universal and Transferable Adversarial Attacks on Aligned Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15043)

Consider this sequence:

Shockingly, this seemingly nonsensical string coerces the ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo model to bypass its safety protocols, pushing it to produce unsafe content. The crux? The appendages at the tail-end. It isn't a mere glitch; researchers have systematically showcased how to automate the construction of these adversarial prompt injections.

### Depth and Breadth of Vulnerabilities

While specific instances like the one above can be patched, the broader issue is the unlimited possibilities these attacks represent. Researchers have created an algorithmic approach to devise these adversarial attacks on LLMs, potentially making a vast number of such vulnerabilities.

### Cross-Model Vulnerabilities

One might argue: "Okay, but that’s for open-source models." Here’s the rub: these attacks, once crafted using open-source LLMs, have proven effective even against closed-source models like ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude. The implications are vast: craft on one model, attack on many.

### Open Questions

As with any groundbreaking discovery, this raises more questions. For instance, does fine-tuning these attacks on a more potent open-source model guarantee broader and more potent jailbreaks? It appears likely. However, one of the looming concerns is the potential backlash against open-source. While vulnerabilities in open systems can be identified, they are instrumental in hardening both open and closed systems.

### Reality Check

Given the inherent nature of LLMs and the infinite ways they can be attacked, achieving a completely secure LLM may remain a pipe dream.

For the specifics, the researchers used Viccuna-7B and LLaMA-2-7B-Chat for initial attack development. When tested on other models such as Pythia, Falcon, Guanaco, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, PaLM-2, and Claude-2, the success rates varied but remained notably high.

### Methodology Spotlight

Key to this attack mechanism is the Greedy Coordinate Gradient-based Search. By optimizing input tokens, this technique is designed to maximize the probability of eliciting a desired response from the LLM, even if it’s potentially harmful.

## Conclusion

If you're in the LLM space, whether as a researcher, developer, or an enthusiast, this is a must-read. Dive into the paper for an in-depth understanding and figure out where we head from here.

Published on 27th July 2023, this paper has since drawn massive attention from the AI community, and the highlighted vulnerabilities have been _partially_ fixed. The work never stops.
