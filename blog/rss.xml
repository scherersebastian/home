            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This article opens with a deep dive into the insights shared by Jeff Bezos, as highlighted in a clip from the Lex Fridman Podcast, <em>Jeff Bezos: Truth is Uncomfortable</em>.</p><p>Jeff Bezos lays it out clear and insightful, making this video a must-watch if you want to get a real feel for his take on speaking the truth and how vital it is for an organization to really excel.</p><iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JL4OoKJyNrc?si=FLuImZ8yiz5bVKFZ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe><p>The summary captures the essence of the clip:</p><p>"Bezos delves into the cultural and psychological challenges of promoting truth-telling within an organization, highlighting the inherent human tendency to prioritize social cohesion over confronting uncomfortable truths. He emphasizes the importance of creating a workplace environment where individuals feel empowered to voice their concerns and challenge existing norms, even when doing so feels awkward or risky. Bezos suggests practical strategies to foster such a culture, including encouraging leaders to speak last in meetings to allow for a broader range of perspectives to be heard. This approach not only facilitates a more open dialogue but also enables organizations to make decisions based on data and evidence, rather than hierarchy or consensus."</p><p>My personal experience also reflects that discussions often devolve into stubbornness, where the focus shifts from finding the best solution or the truth to merely asserting one's own will. As an engineer, I find <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-ten-commandments-of-egoless-programming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Ten Commandments of Egoless Programming</em></a>, summarized by Jeff Atwood in an article, to be very effective in avoiding unnecessary tensions. Hence, here is his summary of the Ten Commandments from the book <em>The Psychology of Computer Programming</em>:</p><blockquote><ol><li><p><strong>Understand and accept that you will make mistakes.</strong> The point is to find them early, before they make it into production. Fortunately, except for the few of us developing rocket guidance software at JPL, mistakes are rarely fatal in our industry, so we can, and should, learn, laugh, and move on.</p></li><li><p><strong>You are not your code.</strong> Remember that the entire point of a review is to find problems, and problems will be found. Don't take it personally when one is uncovered.</p></li><li><p><strong>No matter how much <em>karate</em> you know, someone else will always know more.</strong> Such an individual can teach you some new moves if you ask. Seek and accept input from others, especially when you think it's not needed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Don't rewrite code without consultation.</strong> There's a fine line between "fixing code" and "rewriting code." Know the difference, and pursue stylistic changes within the framework of a code review, not as a lone enforcer.</p></li><li><p><strong>Treat people who know less than you with respect, deference, and patience.</strong> Nontechnical people who deal with developers on a regular basis almost universally hold the opinion that we are prima donnas at best and crybabies at worst. Don't reinforce this stereotype with anger and impatience.</p></li><li><p><strong>The only constant in the world is change.</strong> Be open to it and accept it with a smile. Look at each change to your requirements, platform, or tool as a new challenge, not as some serious inconvenience to be fought.</p></li><li><p><strong>The only true authority stems from knowledge, not from position.</strong> Knowledge engenders authority, and authority engenders respect – so if you want respect in an egoless environment, cultivate knowledge.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fight for what you believe, but gracefully accept defeat.</strong> Understand that sometimes your ideas will be overruled. Even if you do turn out to be right, don't take revenge or say, "I told you so" more than a few times at most, and don't make your dearly departed idea a martyr or rallying cry.</p></li><li><p><strong>Don't be "the guy in the room."</strong> Don't be the guy coding in the dark office emerging only to buy cola. The guy in the room is out of touch, out of sight, and out of control and has no place in an open, collaborative environment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Critique code instead of people – be kind to the coder, not to the code.</strong> As much as possible, make all of your comments positive and oriented to improving the code. Relate comments to local standards, program specs, increased performance, etc.</p></li></ol><p>— Jeff Atwood</p></blockquote><p>In reality, adhering to these ten commandments is easier said than done.</p><p>Sometimes, you have to commit to a solution even if it's not your preferred choice. This concept is also highlighted in the Lex Fridman podcast featuring Jeff Bezos, encapsulated in the phrase <strong>I disagree and commit</strong>.</p><p>Based on my experience, if you respect the individual with whom you're professionally at odds over a preferred solution, stating <em>I disagree and commit</em> becomes significantly easier.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="references">References<a href="#references" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to References" title="Direct link to References">​</a></h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL4OoKJyNrc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeff Bezos: Truth is uncomfortable | Lex Fridman Podcast Clips</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFwCGECvq4I" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeff Bezos on how to make decisions | Lex Fridman Podcast Clips</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-ten-commandments-of-egoless-programming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeff Atwood - The Ten Commandments of Egoless Programming</a></p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In today's world, where keeping apps secure is more critical than ever, developers have a unique edge. They know their code and setup inside out, which means they don't have to wait for a security expert to come in and do a security check. This isn't about dumping more work on developers - they've got enough on their plates already. It's more about encouraging them to use that know-how to check their own work for security issues.
By sticking to some core security principles laid out by Saltzer and Schroeder back in the day (<em>1975</em>), developers can totally handle doing a solid security check on their apps if they want to.</p><p>Saltzer and Schroeder's security basics:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Least Privilege</strong>: Keep it tight. Only give access and permissions for what's absolutely necessary, cutting down on misuse chances.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fail-Safe Defaults</strong>: If you're not sure, say no. Only allow stuff that's explicitly okayed to keep things secure by default.</p></li><li><p><strong>Economy of Mechanism</strong>: Keep it simple. The simpler the security, the easier it is to manage and make sure it's doing its job.</p></li><li><p><strong>Complete Mediation</strong>: Check every access to make sure it's legit, avoiding any sneaky misuse of permissions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Open Design</strong>: Don't rely on keeping your security a secret. A solid system stays secure even when attackers know how it works.</p></li><li><p><strong>Separation of Privilege</strong>: Make sure doing anything important requires more than one check to cut down on abuse.</p></li><li><p><strong>Least Common Mechanism</strong>: Share as little as possible between users and processes to keep attack paths to a minimum.</p></li><li><p><strong>Psychological Acceptability</strong>: Don't make security a pain to use. If it's too annoying, people will just find ways around it.</p></li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="references">References<a href="#references" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to References" title="Direct link to References">​</a></h2><ul><li><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1451869" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Saltzer and Schroeder - <em>The protection of information in computer systems</em></a></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Disclaimer</strong> - This article is compiled from GitHub articles, linked below in the references. The purpose of this article is to serve as a summary since I found the content of the GitHub articles to be well-structured. My personal thoughts are integrated at relevant points.</em></p><p>Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) software supply chains are a lucrative target for threat actors. GitHub Actions is one of the most widely used platforms for automation, making it an important target. It's my personal favourite compared to GitLab CI/CD and Jenkins.</p><p>In the context of workflows, the <em>primary</em> threats include: Command Injections, Pwn Requests, Secret Leaks, and Third-Party Actions.</p><p>Due to the dangers inherent to <em>automatic processing of PRs</em>, an important security guarantee that GitHub makes is that workflows triggered on <code>pull_request</code> from forks (untrusted sources) are run with minimal privileges: no access to secrets and the repository token is read-only. Thus, if a workflow contains potential injection vulnerabilities, but is triggered only on <code>pull_request</code>, then the impact is minimal, because only pull requests from users able to create branches in the same repository are able to trigger the workflow with higher privileges.</p><p><em>Nevertheless, it is better to keep workflows injection free, even if they run with minimal privileges.</em></p><p>In the following sections, the primary threats will be listed along with corresponding tips for mitigation.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="command-injections">Command Injections<a href="#command-injections" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Command Injections" title="Direct link to Command Injections">​</a></h2><p>A workflow is a program that starts automatically when a specific repository event occurs. As with any program potentially started by an external user, user-controlled inputs should be treated as untrusted. In the context of workflows, this means values such as <code>github.event.issue.title</code> or <code>github.event.issue.body</code>. In particular, GitHub Actions expression evaluation is a powerful language-independent feature which may lead to script injections when used in such blocks as <code>run</code>.</p><p>This is a simple example of a workflow that is vulnerable to command injection:</p><div class="language-yaml codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-yaml codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">-</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token key atrule" style="color:#00a4db">run</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">:</span><span class="token plain"> echo "$</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">{</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">{</span><span class="token plain"> github.event.issue.title </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">}</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">}</span><span class="token plain">"</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>To exploit this, an attacker would create an issue with a title like <code>$(touch pwned.txt)</code>.</p><p>Due to the way that the <code>${{}}</code> syntax gets expanded, this causes the workflow to execute the following command <code>echo "$(touch pwned.txt)"</code>.</p><p>Since expression evaluation is language independent, the injection type is not Bash shell-specific. For example, when <code>${{}}</code> is used in a JS script, a syntactically valid construct can be used for injection there, too.</p><p>An attacker could use an injection vulnerability like this to achieve something far more malicious than just modifying a local file. For example, they could upload secrets to a website that they control, or commit new code to your repository to add a backdoor vulnerability or supply chain attack.</p><p><em>When used in the <code>run</code> or <code>script</code> section, the <code>${{ }}</code> syntax is almost always very dangerous.</em></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7"

This way, a dedicated security team can review many repositories, and development teams don't need to delve into the details, allowing them to focus on their development work.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="pwn-requests">Pwn Requests<a href="#pwn-requests" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Pwn Requests" title="Direct link to Pwn Requests">​</a></h2><p>Any automated processing of PRs from an external fork is potentially dangerous and such PRs should be treated like untrusted input. It is common CI/CD practice to ensure that when a new PR is submitted that it does not break the build for your project, that no functionality regressions are introduced, and that tests are passing. But when operating on untrusted PRs, such automated behavior can leave your repository exposed to abuse if you’re not careful.</p><p>Since, by definition, a PR supplies code to any build or test logic in place for your project, attackers can achieve arbitrary code execution in a workflow runner operating on a malicious PR in a variety of ways.</p><p>They may submit malicious changes to the existing build scripts like <code>make</code> or <code>powershell</code> files or redefine the build script in the <code>package.json</code> file. They can simply write their payload as a new test that will be run with others. Any modern build orchestration is complex enough to have multiple code injection points.</p><p>Due to the dangers inherent to automatic processing of PRs, GitHub’s standard pull_request workflow trigger by default prevents write permissions and secrets access to the target repository.</p><p>However, in some scenarios such access is needed to properly process the PR. To this end the <code>pull_request_target</code> and <code>workflow_run</code> workflow triggers were introduced. They enable scenarios that require building the untrusted code, access to repository secrets and also need write permissions to update the PR with e.g. code coverage results or other test results.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tip-3-do-not-use-pull_request_target">Tip 3: Do Not Use <code>pull_request_target</code><a href="#tip-3-do-not-use-pull_request_target" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to tip-3-do-not-use-pull_request_target" title="Direct link to tip-3-do-not-use-pull_request_target">​</a></h3><p>My personal advice is to never use these workflow triggers because they unnecessarily increase the attack surface.

They can simply use the <code>pull_request</code> trigger instead.</p><p>You may ask yourself: if the <code>pull_request_target</code> workflow only checks out and builds the PR, i.e. runs untrusted code but doesn’t reference any secrets, is it still vulnerable?</p><p>Yes it is, because a workflow triggered on <code>pull_request_target</code> still has the read/write repository token in memory that is potentially available to any running program. If the workflow uses <code>actions/checkout</code> and does not pass the optional parameter <code>persist-credentials</code> as <code>false</code>, it makes it even worse. The default for the parameter is <code>true</code>. It means that in any subsequent steps any running code can simply read the stored repository token from the disk.</p><p>Just stick to the <code>pull_request</code> trigger.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tip-4-add-a-condition-to-the-pull_request_target">Tip 4: Add a Condition to the <code>pull_request_target</code><a href="#tip-4-add-a-condition-to-the-pull_request_target" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to tip-4-add-a-condition-to-the-pull_request_target" title="Direct link to tip-4-add-a-condition-to-the-pull_request_target">​</a></h3><p>Add a condition to the <code>pull_request_target</code> to run only if a certain label is assigned the PR, like <code>safe to test</code> that indicates the PR has been vetted by someone with write privileges to the target repository.

As such this approach should only be used as a temporary solution, until a proper fix from the options above is applied. Since external users do not have the permission to assign labels, this effectively requires repository owners to manually review changes first and is also prone to human error.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tip-5-rebase-prs-after-fixing-a-vulnerable-workflow">Tip 5: Rebase PRs After Fixing a Vulnerable Workflow<a href="#tip-5-rebase-prs-after-fixing-a-vulnerable-workflow" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Tip 5: Rebase PRs After Fixing a Vulnerable Workflow" title="Direct link to Tip 5: Rebase PRs After Fixing a Vulnerable Workflow">​</a></h3><p>All PRs that were opened before a fix was made to the vulnerable workflow will use the version of the workflow as it existed at the time the PR was opened.

the first case, the generated shell script is stored on disk and can be accessed there. In the second case it depends on the way the program is using the argument.</p><p><code>Actions/checkout</code> action by default stores the repository token in a <code>.git/config</code> file unless the <code>persist-credentials: false</code> argument is set. Even if this is not the case the repository token and secrets are still in memory. Although GitHub Actions scrub secrets from memory that are not referenced in the workflow or in an included Action, the repository token, whether it is referenced or not, and any referenced secrets can be harvested by a determined attacker.</p><p>The next question for the attacker is how to exfiltrate such secrets from the runner. GitHub Actions automatically redact secrets printed to the log in order to prevent accidental secret disclosure, but it is not a true security boundary since it is impossible to protect from intentional logging, so exfiltration of obfuscated secrets is still possible. For example: <code>echo ${SOME_SECRET:0:4}; echo ${SOME_SECRET:4:200};</code>. Also, since the attacker may run arbitrary commands it is possible to simply make a HTTP request to an external attacker-controlled server with the secret.</p><p>Getting a repository access token is a bit harder. An Action runner gets a generated token with permissions that are limited to the repository that contains the workflow and which expires after the workflow completes. Once expired, the token is no longer useful to an attacker. One way to work around this limitation, is to automate the attack and perform it in fractions of a second by calling an attacker-controlled server with the token. The attacker server can use the GitHub API to modify repository content, including releases.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tip-6-keep-workflows-injection-free">Tip 6: Keep

You can set up actions to automatically accept and merge these pull requests from Dependabot. However, accepting changes without reviewing them isn’t the most secure approach.

By applying the concepts of least privilege, change attestation, and tracking as well as ensuring that third parties don’t have mutable control over your CI/CD supply chain, you can actively start to take charge of your CI/CD supply chain security.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="references">References<a href="#references" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to References" title="Direct link to References">​</a></h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://github.blog/2023-08-09-four-tips-to-keep-your-github-actions-workflows-secure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Four tips to keep your GitHub Actions workflows secure</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Keeping your GitHub Actions and workflows secure Part 1: Preventing pwn requests</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-untrusted-input/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Keeping your GitHub Actions and workflows secure Part 2: Untrusted input</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-building-blocks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Keeping your GitHub Actions and workflows secure Part 3: How to trust your building blocks</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://blog.gitguardian.com/github-actions-security-cheat-sheet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Actions Security Best Practices - cheat sheet included</a></p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The paper <em>"Do Users Write More Insecure Code with AI Assistants?"</em> focuses on a study examining user interactions with an AI Code assistant in programming tasks, particularly those involving security. The main findings are:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Decreased Code Security with AI Assistance</strong>: Users who utilized an AI assistant, specifically based on OpenAI's codex-davinci-002 model, tended to write code that was significantly less secure compared to those who did not use the assistant.</p></li><li><p><strong>Perception vs. Reality</strong>: There was a notable discrepancy in perception among users who had access to the AI assistant; they were more likely to believe their code was secure, even though it was less secure in reality.</p></li><li><p><strong>Impact of User Engagement and Trust</strong>: The study found that users who were less trusting of the AI and who actively modified their prompts (e.g., by re-phrasing questions or adjusting settings) produced code with fewer security vulnerabilities.</p></li></ol><p>The study aims to inform the development of future AI-based coding assistants by providing a detailed analysis of how users interact with these tools and the impact on code security. The authors also released the user interface used in the study to encourage similar research in the future. This paper contributes to the broader understanding of the implications of AI assistance in coding, especially in the context of writing secure code.</p><p>Without specific instructions for security, the AI-generated code might be vulnerable. However, when directed to prioritize security, the AI produces more secure code. </p><p>The AI can also effectively review its own code for security issues.</p><p>We'll see what the future holds.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="references">References<a href="#references" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to References" title="Direct link to References">​</a></h2><ul><li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03622" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Do Users Write More Insecure Code with AI Assistants? - Neil Perry, Megha Srivastava, Deepak Kumar, Dan Boneh</a></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

It not only creates issues for new findings but also auto-closes resolved ones.</p><p>This tool is compatible with nearly all security tools that use the SARIF format. It bridges the gap between security scan results and your GitHub issues tab, automatically generating issues from detected vulnerabilities and risks.</p><p>A distinguishing feature of IssueInjector is its capability to <em>bypass the GitHub Advanced Security Dashboard</em>. This means users can view and manage findings directly in GitHub, even <em>without the Advanced Security</em> subscription, eliminating the need to switch between platforms for each security tool.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-to-use">How To Use<a href="#how-to-use" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How To Use" title="Direct link to How To Use">​</a></h2><p>The IssueInjector GitHub Action processes SARIF files to create GitHub issues based on the findings. It filters findings based on severity and ensures that issues are properly labeled.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="prerequisites">Prerequisites<a href="#prerequisites" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Prerequisites" title="Direct link to Prerequisites">​</a></h3><p>Make sure you have a SARIF file that you want to process.

filter the findings (optional, default is "error").</p></li><li><p><strong>GITHUB_TOKEN</strong>: GitHub token to authenticate with the API.</p></li><li><p><strong>GITHUB_REPO</strong>: The GitHub

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>While I personally lean towards the Coordinated Disclosure approach, in this article I delve deep into the perspective of my more free-thinking security colleagues to better understand their viewpoint.</em></p><p>Ensuring that software or hardware vendors can address vulnerabilities before bad actors can find and exploit them is crucial.</p><p>Vulnerability disclosures can be controversial because vendors often prefer to wait until a patch or other form of mitigation is available before making the vulnerability public. However, security professionals and enterprises whose sensitive data or systems may be at risk prefer that disclosures be made public as soon as possible.</p><p>All software has security vulnerabilities, and demonstrating a clear and established process for handling and disclosing them gives far more confidence in the security of the software than trying to hide the issues.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Twitter disclosure" src="/home/assets/images/twitter-disclosure-f51bad8d812529b35a0e7d309e1c1235.png" width="590" height="523" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><em>As a side note, <a href="https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/security-researcher-launches-gofundme-campaign-to-fight-legal-threat-over-vulnerability-disclosure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this happened</a> before Elon Musk acquired Twitter.</em></p><p><strong>Full disclosure</strong> is the practice of publishing analysis of software vulnerabilities as early as possible, making the data accessible to everyone without restriction. The primary purpose of widely disseminating information about vulnerabilities is so that potential victims are as knowledgeable as those who attack them.</p><blockquote><p><em>"Full disclosure, - the practice of making the details of security vulnerabilities public - is a damned good idea. Public scrutiny is the only reliable way to improve security, while secrecy only makes us less secure".</em></p><p>~ Bruce Schneier</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>"We don't believe in security by obscurity, and as far as we know, full disclosure is the only way to ensure that everyone, not just the insiders, has access to the information we need".</em></p><p>~ Leonard Rose</p></blockquote><p><strong>Arguments for full disclosure:</strong></p><p>There are some fundamental problems with coordinated disclosure that full disclosure can resolve:</p><ul><li><p>If customers do not know about vulnerabilities, they cannot request patches, and vendors experience no economic incentive to correct vulnerabilities.</p></li><li><p>Administrators cannot make informed decisions about the risks to their systems, as information on vulnerabilities is restricted.</p></li><li><p>Malicious researchers who also know about the flaw have a long period of time to continue exploiting the flaw.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Arguments against full disclosure:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Many end-users cannot benefit from access to vulnerability information without guidance or patches from the vendor</p></li><li><p>Sharing research with malicious actors, low-skilled attackers can use this information to perform sophisticated attacks that would otherwise be beyond their ability</p></li><li><p><em>Less</em> exposure to malicious attacks while the update is being developed</p></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2><p>The full disclosure approach is primarily used in response to organisations ignoring reported vulnerabilities, in order to put pressure on them to develop and publish a fix.</p><p>It is seen as irresponsible by many people. Generally it should only be considered as a last resort, when all other methods have failed, or when exploit code is already publicly available.</p><p>Disclosures help to ensure transparency. When you don't operate transparently, your reputation is likely to take a much bigger hit in the event that a major vulnerability emerges and it comes to light that you failed to disclose it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During my work as a security engineer on the CatenaX project, I made a significant discovery. We had integrated the Veracode tool, and developers could only access their findings by switching to the Veracode platform. This meant that developers had to go through the time-comsuming process of logging into another platform, creating a new set of credentials, requesting access, and then attempting to locate their findings within the huge Veracode platform. It was an ineffective and frustrating process.</p><p>Out of this pain and the desire to streamline the workflow for developers, I created <a href="https://github.com/scherersebastian/issue-injector" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>IssueInjector</strong></a>. For a deeper dive into the technical details of Issue Injector, you can refer to a separate article. In this article, we'll focus on why this workflow is so beneficial for developers.</p><p>In the realm of security, ensuring that vulnerabilities are addressed promptly is of utmost importance. But when and how should these vulnerabilities be shared within an organization?</p><p>This article explores the idea of seamlessly integrating findings and potential threats directly into the development workflow as issues or stories.</p><p>Such an approach not only streamlines the process but also empowers developers to address security concerns efficiently without leaving their familiar development environment.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-efficiency-of-integrated-findings">The Efficiency of Integrated Findings<a href="#the-efficiency-of-integrated-findings" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Efficiency of Integrated Findings" title="Direct link to The Efficiency of Integrated Findings">​</a></h2><p>Traditionally, security findings and potential threats have been reported via email or external reports, often leading to communication challenges and a lack of integration into the development workflow. However, there are compelling reasons to advocate for reporting these concerns as issues or stories directly within the development project, whether it's innersource or a private repository.</p><p><strong>Why is this approach beneficial?</strong></p><p>Imagine a scenario where a company employs multiple security tools for SCA (Software Composition Analysis), SAST (Static Application Security Testing), DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing), Secret Scanning, and Container Scanning. In a traditional setup, developers would need to switch between multiple dashboards and tools to access findings from each security tool. This can be time-consuming and disrupt the development workflow.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-info alert alert--info admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>info</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>This is what happens when you let security people with no engineering background develop a developer-friendly security process.</p></div></div><p>Here's where the GitHub action <a href="https://github.com/scherersebastian/issue-injector" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>IssueInjector</strong></a> becomes invaluable.

This approach not only promotes transparency, accountability, and efficiency but also enhances collaboration between development and security teams. By streamlining the integration of findings as development issues or stories, organizations can strengthen their security posture and respond more effectively to potential threats.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The crux? The appendages at the tail-end. It isn't a mere glitch; researchers have systematically showcased how to automate the construction of these adversarial prompt injections.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="depth-and-breadth-of-vulnerabilities">Depth and Breadth of Vulnerabilities<a href="#depth-and-breadth-of-vulnerabilities" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Depth and Breadth of Vulnerabilities" title="Direct link to Depth and Breadth of Vulnerabilities">​</a></h3><p>While specific instances like the one above can be patched, the broader issue is the unlimited possibilities these attacks represent. Researchers have created an algorithmic approach to devise these adversarial attacks on LLMs, potentially making a vast number of such vulnerabilities.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="cross-model-vulnerabilities">Cross-Model Vulnerabilities<a href="#cross-model-vulnerabilities" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Cross-Model Vulnerabilities" title="Direct link to Cross-Model Vulnerabilities">​</a></h3><p>One might argue: "Okay, but that’s for open-source models." Here’s the rub: these attacks, once crafted using open-source LLMs, have proven effective even against closed-source models like ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude.

For instance, does fine-tuning these attacks on a more potent open-source model guarantee broader and more potent jailbreaks? It appears likely. However, one of the looming concerns is the potential backlash against open-source. While vulnerabilities in open systems can be identified, they are instrumental in hardening both open and closed systems.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="reality-check">Reality Check<a href="#reality-check" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Reality Check" title="Direct link to Reality Check">​</a></h3><p>Given the inherent nature of LLMs and the infinite ways they can be attacked, achieving a completely secure LLM may remain a pipe dream.</p><p>For the specifics, the researchers used Viccuna-7B and LLaMA-2-7B-Chat for initial attack development.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>GitHub's Copilot Chat takes AI in development to a new level. Integrated into your code editor, this chatbot enhances the already impressive GitHub Copilot. Its revolutionary aspect lies in increased interactivity, allowing for nuanced communication with AI. Currently in beta, it's available for enterprise customers using Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="more-than-just-a-code-generator">More Than Just a Code Generator<a href="#more-than-just-a-code-generator" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to More Than Just a Code Generator" title="Direct link to More Than Just a Code Generator">​</a></h2><p>While GitHub Copilot already offers code suggestions, Copilot Chat takes AI interaction up a notch by enabling real-time dialogue. Instead of just generating code, you can now discuss it, ask follow-up questions, and request explanations. The full chat history is saved, aiding in context retention and deeper code understanding.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="context-aware-code-suggestions-for-enhanced-productivity">Context-Aware Code Suggestions for Enhanced Productivity<a href="#context-aware-code-suggestions-for-enhanced-productivity" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Context-Aware Code Suggestions for Enhanced Productivity" title="Direct link to Context-Aware Code Suggestions for Enhanced Productivity">​</a></h2><p>GitHub Copilot Chat is unique in its real-time, context-aware capabilities. It's <em>"more than just a chat window,"</em> offering tailored programming support, real-time advice, security fixes, and code analysis.</p><p>The example below performs a security code review with GitHub CoPilot Chat for a Dockerfile.</p><blockquote><p>Perform a security code review for the selected code, consider known security rules related to container security.</p></blockquote><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Dockerfile Security Code Reivew" src="/home/assets/images/Screenshot_from_2023-09-11_19-21-02-c1c8e2d078f6661f069d50b095033e0e.png" width="1920" height="967" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The Dockerfile configures the root user which is a security risk, as a compromised container could potentially endanger the host server or other containers. This also contradicts the principle of least privilege, which states that software should run with the minimal necessary permissions to minimize potential security risks. Additionally, containers running as root can make unintended and potentially harmful changes to the system.</p><p>Now you can ask Copilot Chat why this was not listed in the security code review (<em>~best practice: review your outputs because of hallucinations</em>).</p><blockquote><p>Why don't you say anything about the root user?</p></blockquote><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Dockerfile Security Code Reivew No Root" src="/home/assets/images/Screenshot_from_2023-09-12_21-42-42-6b2f7c419f5ae1594f9c488d9aea02a8.png" width="1918" height="414" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="limited-scope">Limited Scope<a href="#limited-scope" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Limited Scope" title="Direct link to Limited Scope">​</a></h2><p>Despite its strengths, GitHub Copilot Chat has limitations. It struggles with complex code structures and less common languages, and suggestion quality varies based on the language's representation in the training data. The tool is not designed to tackle overarching design or architecture issues.</p><p>Additionally, Copilot and Copilot Chat can only process individual files or code snippets, limited to around 2000 tokens. However, this cap is expected to increase in future versions.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2><p>To wrap it up, GitHub Copilot Chat is a game-changer. It's not just about spitting out code; it lets you have a real conversation with the AI to dig deeper into your code issues. Sure, it's got some limits, like not being great with obscure languages and not handling an entire repo. But overall, it's a promising tool that could make our coding lives a whole lot easier.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="references">References<a href="#references" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to References" title="Direct link to References">​</a></h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/github-copilot-chat/about-github-copilot-chat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/github-copilot-chat/about-github-copilot-chat</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/artificial-intelligence#_chat-view" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/artificial-intelligence#_chat-view</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Kuenstliche-Intelligenz-GitHub-Copilot-Chat-als-Beta-fuer-Unternehmen-gestartet-9222292.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.heise.de/news/Kuenstliche-Intelligenz-GitHub-Copilot-Chat-als-Beta-fuer-Unternehmen-gestartet-9222292.html</a></p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the age of advanced machine learning, we have gained an assistant that never tires, is always ahead of the business curve, and boasts the combined knowledge of the world with an IQ of 145. The challenge now? Mastering the art of prompt engineering to communicate effectively with this unparalleled digital assistant.</p><p>If you think ChatGPT is just a toy to generate random text, you're wildly missing the mark. This model can be your trusty sidekick, an assistant that can tackle anything from code to research. But you've got to know how to talk to it. No, I don't mean saying <em>please</em> and <em>thank you</em>.</p><p>Prompt engineering is not straightforward; it requires careful thought and various considerations.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Prompt engineering meme" src="/home/assets/images/prompt-engineering-dark-art-f0f2aacb0911317efff6583494da76b4.jpeg" width="1000" height="563" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-principles-of-prompting-the-basics">The Principles of Prompting: The Basics<a href="#the-principles-of-prompting-the-basics" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Principles of Prompting: The Basics" title="Direct link to The Principles of Prompting: The Basics">​</a></h2><p>Alright, before we get into the nitty-gritty techniques, let's set the stage with some principles.</p><ul><li><p>Write <strong>clear, detailed</strong> instructions.</p></li><li><p>Specify the <strong>format</strong>, like summaries, lists, or bullet points.</p></li><li><p>Use <strong>system messages and role-playing</strong> to enhance the interaction.</p></li><li><p>Limit <strong>scope</strong> for broad topics.</p></li><li><p>Avoid leading the model to a specific answer.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Instead of:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Write 5 tech articles.</p></blockquote><p><strong>A well-engineered prompt would look like:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Generate titles and abstracts for 5 tech articles focusing on the impact of machine learning on healthcare. Each abstract should be around 100-150 words. Aim for topics that would be relevant for CTOs of healthcare startups. Output the results as a numbered list.</p></blockquote><p>Here, the revised prompt leaves no room for misinterpretation. It clearly specifies the number of articles, the subject focus (machine learning in healthcare), the target audience (CTOs of healthcare startups), and even the format in which the output should be presented. The more specific you are, the more accurate and tailored the output will be.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="prompt-wording">Prompt Wording<a href="#prompt-wording" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Prompt Wording" title="Direct link to Prompt Wording">​</a></h2><p>The way you phrase your prompt is crucial for getting the output you want from a language learning model like ChatGPT. The model needs clear and accurate language to deliver useful answers. If you're not sure about the terminology in a particular field, this could limit the quality of the model's responses—think of it like doing a web search with the wrong keywords.</p><p>Essentially, prompt wording isn't a standalone method but serves as the backbone for all other prompting techniques.</p><p><em>Sorry PHP developers, you still have to learn a new proper language.</em></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="prompt-engineering-strategies">Prompt Engineering Strategies<a href="#prompt-engineering-strategies" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Prompt Engineering Strategies" title="Direct link to Prompt Engineering Strategies">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="inputoutput-prompting">Input/Output Prompting<a href="#inputoutput-prompting" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Input/Output Prompting" title="Direct link to Input/Output Prompting">​</a></h3><p>The elementary method of asking and receiving.</p><p>Instead of:</p><blockquote><p>Translate the following text into French.</p></blockquote><p>Say:</p><blockquote><p>Translate the following English text into French: "The weather is fine."</p></blockquote><p>Clarity is king.

Few-Shot: Recommend video games based on my liking for "Animal Crossing," "Stardew Valley," and "Harvest Moon."</p></blockquote><p>Your level of specificity dictates the relevance of the recommendations.</p><p>Zero-shot uses the model's existing training to answer queries without additional data. Few-shot prompting uses limited additional examples to guide the model to a desired output. For example, specifying personal preferences like "Ania's favorite foods are burgers, fries, and pizza" can help the model give restaurant recommendations in a location like Dubai.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="chain-of-thought-prompting">Chain-of-Thought Prompting<a href="#chain-of-thought-prompting" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Chain-of-Thought Prompting" title="Direct link to Chain-of-Thought Prompting">​</a></h3><p>For problems that require more brainpower, guide the model through a logical progression.</p><blockquote><p>How would you optimize a bubble sort algorithm for efficiency?

Simply put, an AI hallucination occurs when the model outputs data that is either blatantly incorrect or unusually distorted, often due to the misinterpretation of the input prompt or the underlying training data.</p><p>In machine learning, a model's ability to generalize from its training data to unseen data is crucial. However, sometimes this generalization goes awry. The model might extrapolate from its training in ways that, while mathematically plausible given its training set, are practically nonsensical or misleading.</p><p>Google's Deep Dream serves as a quintessential example in the image domain, transforming benign pictures into nightmarish arrays of repetitive patterns. While entertaining in the context of art, hallucinations can become problematic when we rely on the model for mission-critical tasks such as medical diagnosis, financial analysis, or autonomous vehicle control.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="mitigating-the-risk">Mitigating the Risk<a href="#mitigating-the-risk" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Mitigating the Risk" title="Direct link to Mitigating the Risk">​</a></h3><p>There are several ways to detect and mitigate the risks of AI hallucinations:</p><ol><li><p>Data Quality: Ensure that the model is trained on high-quality, unbiased data.</p></li><li><p>Model Auditing: Regularly evaluate the model's output in different scenarios to identify any erratic behavior.</p></li><li><p>Output Validation: Include a layer of human oversight or automated checks to validate the model's output against known parameters or ground truth.</p></li></ol><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="best-practice-review-your-outputs">Best Practice: Review Your Outputs<a href="#best-practice-review-your-outputs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Best Practice: Review Your Outputs" title="Direct link to Best Practice: Review Your Outputs">​</a></h3><p>It's essential to critically review any machine-generated output, particularly in contexts where an incorrect response can have significant ramifications.</p><p>By understanding the mechanics and pitfalls of AI hallucinations, engineers can better anticipate these anomalies and put measures in place to prevent or catch them, thereby ensuring more robust and reliable machine learning implementations.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="text-embeddings">Text Embeddings<a href="#text-embeddings" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Text Embeddings" title="Direct link to Text Embeddings">​</a></h2><p>Text embeddings convert textual data into high-dimensional vectors that capture semantic meaning, serving as the backbone of any natural language processing (NLP) based application.</p><p>Understanding textual data is essential for companies that deal with customer interactions, analytics, or decision-making based on textual information. Text embeddings can supercharge applications like customer service chatbots, sentiment analysis tools, or search engines to offer accurate and contextually relevant results.</p><p>Imagine a chatbot integrated into Mercedes' online showroom platform, designed to help potential customers with their car-buying experience. A customer might ask, <em>"Tell me about the fuel efficiency of the E-Class."</em> Another might inquire, <em>"What's the gas mileage on the E-Class sedan?"</em></p><p>By leveraging text embeddings, the chatbot can understand that "fuel efficiency" and "gas mileage" are semantically similar queries, even though the wording is different. These terms are converted into high-dimensional vectors that cluster closely in the semantic space, allowing the chatbot to recognize them as related.</p><p>With this capability, the chatbot can provide detailed and relevant information to potential buyers, enhancing the customer experience and possibly accelerating the sales process. This is particularly important for a premium brand like Mercedes, where customers expect high levels of personalized service. Text embeddings make the chatbot more adaptable and efficient, which is crucial for a luxury automaker aiming to offer a customer experience as polished as the cars it sells.</p><p>In summary, text embeddings are vital for companies seeking to leverage NLP in targeted applications, offering superior understanding and performance compared to traditional lexical methods.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-hands-on-example">A Hands-on Example<a href="#a-hands-on-example" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A Hands-on Example" title="Direct link to A Hands-on Example">​</a></h2><p>Below, we delve into a practical illustration. Here is an example of a crafted prompt used in a Supabase context:</p><blockquote><p>You are a very enthusiastic Supabase representative who loves to help people. Given the following sections from the Supabase documentation, answer the question using only that information. Output it in markdown format. If you're unsure and the answer is not explicitly written in the documentation, say "sorry, I don't know how to help with that".</p><p>Context sections:
{{context text placeholder}}</p><p>Question: """
{{question placeholder}}
"""</p><p>Answer as markdown, including related code snippets if available.</p></blockquote><p>In the shared example, various components were embedded in the prompt:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Identity</strong>: This sets the stage, providing the model with a role or persona. In the case of the example, the model is given the identity of a "very enthusiastic Supabase representative". This primes the model for the subsequent tasks and influences its tonality.</p></li><li><p><strong>Task</strong>: Explicit instructions for what you want the model to do. This can be as simple as "answer the question" or more complex, setting boundaries on the type of answer expected.</p></li><li><p><strong>Condition</strong>: This safeguards against the model's tendencies to "hallucinate" or generate information that might not be accurate or desired. Setting conditions like "if unsure, say 'I don't know'" helps in managing the response's reliability.</p></li><li><p><strong>Context</strong>: By using context injection, we feed the model with information that will guide its answer. In the case of Supabase, it was sections from its documentation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Labels</strong>: Labels provide structure. They help clarify sections of the prompt and reinforce the instructions provided in the task.</p></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="safeguarding-against-undesired-responses">Safeguarding Against Undesired Responses<a href="#safeguarding-against-undesired-responses" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Safeguarding Against Undesired Responses" title="Direct link to Safeguarding Against Undesired Responses">​</a></h3><p>Using conditions and context effectively can help in preventing the model from generating undesired outputs. As noted, GPT can sometimes exude overconfidence even in incorrect answers. Setting up conditions like "if the answer isn't in the documentation, say 'I don't know'" is one way to counteract this.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="special-characters-and-their-role">Special Characters and Their Role<a href="#special-characters-and-their-role" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Special Characters and Their Role" title="Direct link to Special Characters and Their Role">​</a></h3><p>Triple quotes (<code>"""</code>) around a segment of the prompt, as recommended by OpenAI, can help in explicitly defining the boundaries of a section. It serves a dual purpose – making it clear to the model and preventing potential prompt injections from malicious actors.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="emphasizing-desired-formatting">Emphasizing Desired Formatting<a href="#emphasizing-desired-formatting" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Emphasizing Desired Formatting" title="Direct link to Emphasizing Desired Formatting">​</a></h3><p>By specifying the desired format, like "answer as markdown", you instruct the model to structure its output in a certain way. This is particularly useful if you're looking to display the model's output in a specific visual or structural format.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2><p>Engineering your prompts is akin to fine-tuning an already high-performance machine. With the right tweaks, you can go from getting adequate outputs to having a full-fledged, task-smashing assistant.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Info:</strong> As an interesting aside—while writing this article and drawing from a specific source (which I've naturally credited), I discovered that others have done the same. However, I took the extra step of omitting the mundane details, refining the examples, and only including what aligns with my own experience. What they did was simply have an AI rewrite the entire text and then repost it without any attribution. This raises ethical questions about intellectual property and the authenticity of the content we consume online. I plan to delve deeper into this issue in a separate blog post.</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="references">References<a href="#references" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to References" title="Direct link to References">​</a></h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/prompt-engineering-for-effective-interaction-with-chatgpt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prompt Engineering for Effective Interaction with ChatGPT</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZvnD73m40o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prompt Engineering Tutorial – Master ChatGPT and LLM Responses <em>(Ania Kubow on freeCodeCamp)</em></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yhtjd7yGGGA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ClippyGPT - How I Built Supabase’s OpenAI Doc Search (Embeddings)</a></p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The responsibility of the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is twofold: to define cybersecurity norms and endorse related products. Alarmingly, they are behind in both areas. As quantum computing threats surface, this delay might lead to an unprecedented crisis.</p><p>Two glaring issues stand out: the FIPS 140-3 certification backlog and the slow pace of post-quantum cryptography advancements.</p><p>FIPS 140-3, which outlines encryption standards for a broad range of technologies, is grappling with significant product approval backlogs. If not addressed soon, this lag might become a pivotal crisis, especially with rapid quantum tech developments.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-brief-dive-into-fips-140-3-delays">A Brief Dive into FIPS 140-3 Delays<a href="#a-brief-dive-into-fips-140-3-delays" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A Brief Dive into FIPS 140-3 Delays" title="Direct link to A Brief Dive into FIPS 140-3 Delays">​</a></h2><p>Starting its journey in January 1994 with FIPS 140-1, this standard has evolved through collaboration between government and industry stakeholders. FIPS 140-2 was introduced in 2001 and quickly became the foundation for the global standard ISO/IEC 19790:2006 by 2006.</p><p>FIPS 140-3, introduced in 2019, brought in some modifications. While core encryption methods remained intact, FIPS 140-3 enhanced security assessments across a cryptographic module's lifecycle and mandated differentiated administrative roles. Vendors had adjustments to make, primarily at the firmware level.</p><p>Three years post-launch, a surprising fact is the completion of just seven validations, with a baffling 189 still in the pipeline. The reasons behind these delays, given the modest changes introduced, remain mysterious.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="quantum-resistant-algorithms-progress-so-far">Quantum-Resistant Algorithms: Progress So Far<a href="#quantum-resistant-algorithms-progress-so-far" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Quantum-Resistant Algorithms: Progress So Far" title="Direct link to Quantum-Resistant Algorithms: Progress So Far">​</a></h2><p>Simultaneously, NIST's commitment to developing quantum-resistant cryptographic techniques, initiated in 2016, seems slow. Seven years in, only four algorithms have seen the light of day, with NIST hinting that several are still under review, a process that might span years.</p><p>This slow pace is concerning, especially when considering the typical 4-6 year timeframe from standard introduction to product implementation and subsequent market launch.</p><p>The crux of the matter is the uncertainty surrounding NIST's capability to release these algorithms in a timely manner, ensuring they're ready before quantum breakthroughs render current tech obsolete. The rapid advancements in quantum technology, contrasted with NIST's slow progress, raise significant concerns.</p><p>Given NIST's global leadership role in standards and validation, its current trajectory is unsettling. Quantum breakthroughs are becoming commonplace, and major cyber breaches are daily headlines. The looming <em>harvest now, decrypt later</em> quantum threat amplifies these concerns.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2><p>It's evident that there's a pressing need for robust, futuristic standards and a proactive governing body. Regrettably, both are missing currently. It's a hopeful watch as to whether the US Administration's Cybersecurity Strategy will offer a solution.</p>]]></content:encoded>
