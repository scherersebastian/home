# U.S. Encryption Protocols Lagging: A Global Concern

The responsibility of the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is twofold: to define cybersecurity norms and endorse related products. Alarmingly, they are behind in both areas. As quantum computing threats surface, this delay might lead to an unprecedented crisis.

Two glaring issues stand out: the FIPS 140-3 certification backlog and the slow pace of post-quantum cryptography advancements.

FIPS 140-3, which outlines encryption standards for a broad range of technologies, is grappling with significant product approval backlogs. If not addressed soon, this lag might become a pivotal crisis, especially with rapid quantum tech developments.

## A Brief Dive into FIPS 140-3 Delays

Starting its journey in January 1994 with FIPS 140-1, this standard has evolved through collaboration between government and industry stakeholders. FIPS 140-2 was introduced in 2001 and quickly became the foundation for the global standard ISO/IEC 19790:2006 by 2006.

FIPS 140-3, introduced in 2019, brought in some modifications. While core encryption methods remained intact, FIPS 140-3 enhanced security assessments across a cryptographic module's lifecycle and mandated differentiated administrative roles. Vendors had adjustments to make, primarily at the firmware level.

Three years post-launch, a surprising fact is the completion of just seven validations, with a baffling 189 still in the pipeline. The reasons behind these delays, given the modest changes introduced, remain mysterious.

## Quantum-Resistant Algorithms: Progress So Far

Simultaneously, NIST's commitment to developing quantum-resistant cryptographic techniques, initiated in 2016, seems slow. Seven years in, only four algorithms have seen the light of day, with NIST hinting that several are still under review, a process that might span years.

This slow pace is concerning, especially when considering the typical 4-6 year timeframe from standard introduction to product implementation and subsequent market launch.

The crux of the matter is the uncertainty surrounding NIST's capability to release these algorithms in a timely manner, ensuring they're ready before quantum breakthroughs render current tech obsolete. The rapid advancements in quantum technology, contrasted with NIST's slow progress, raise significant concerns.

Given NIST's global leadership role in standards and validation, its current trajectory is unsettling. Quantum breakthroughs are becoming commonplace, and major cyber breaches are daily headlines. The looming _harvest now, decrypt later_ quantum threat amplifies these concerns.

## Conclusion

It's evident that there's a pressing need for robust, futuristic standards and a proactive governing body. Regrettably, both are missing currently. It's a hopeful watch as to whether the US Administration's Cybersecurity Strategy will offer a solution.
