# Threat Modeling

This section and its subsequent subsections cover the fundamentals of Threat Modeling.

Threat Modeling is an engineering-focused approach to proactively identify and prioritize system vulnerabilities. It involves creating a system architecture model detailing data flows, entry/exit points, and component interactions. Engineers utilize this model to simulate attack scenarios, pinpointing critical vulnerabilities.

This practice is fundamental to initiate a robust security strategy, guiding resource allocation for system hardening.

In the following sections, two approaches are presented. The first is detailed, best suited for security professionals to execute, while the second is a streamlined version designed for development teams to conduct as a self-assessment.
