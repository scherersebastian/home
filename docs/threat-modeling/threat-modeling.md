# Threat Modeling

Threat Modeling is a proactive security practice aimed at systematically identifying, prioritizing, and addressing security vulnerabilities in a system. It starts by creating a detailed model of the system's architecture, covering data flows, entry and exit points, and all interacting components. This model serves as a comprehensive blueprint that engineers use to simulate various attack scenarios.

Threat modeling serves as an essential first step for implementing a security strategy. By running simulated attacks on the system model, engineers can identify critical vulnerabilities.

You threat model to identify threats to your component, which then lets you know where you need to concentrate your resources.

Effectively laying the groundwork for building a secure infrastructure from the ground up.
