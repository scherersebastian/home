# Communication of Services

**If the services are not published, it's like they don't exist.** Colleagues and customers cannot find the services.

Publishing processes with full transparency within a company is valuable for several reasons. Key reasons to publish processes include:

- Standardization: Promotes consistent task performance across the organization.

- Improved efficiency: Reduces time spent searching for information or guidance.

- Knowledge sharing: Fosters a culture of continuous improvement.

- Easier onboarding and training: Streamlines employee integration and role understanding.

- Quality control: Ensures clear guidelines and expectations, resulting in fewer errors.

- Accountability: Clarifies roles and responsibilities for individuals or teams.

- Continuous improvement: Simplifies identifying and monitoring areas for improvement.

- Compliance and risk management: Helps adherence to regulations and minimizes risk.

- Collaboration and communication: Encourages a shared understanding of tasks and team contributions.

- Time savings: Writing down processes once and making them available to everyone can save time in the long run. This reduces the need for repeated explanations or training, and employees can refer to the documentation whenever needed.

In summary, publishing processes supports various aspects of business operations while fostering a culture of collaboration, accountability, and compliance.

## How I like to do it

A separate section for each process or service. In Docusaurus or other documentation frameworks this is equivalent to a sidebar tab.

- Page one: A short summary with the service blueprint graphic. Page can be built like a sales page, depending on the service or process.

- Page two: A video or [HTML presentation](remote-presentations.md) of the service. Integrating the presentation directly into the web page makes sharing especially easy (_compared to a well known product from MS_). The presentation or video can be clicked through by the customer or used by a colleague for demonstration.

- Page three: A detailed explanation of the process with related links.

- Page four: A list of frequently asked questions.
